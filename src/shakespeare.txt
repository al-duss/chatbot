ACT I
SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black 

COUNTESS

    In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

BERTRAM

    And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
    anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
    whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

LAFEU

    You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
    sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
    good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
    worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
    than lack it where there is such abundance.

COUNTESS

    What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

LAFEU

    He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
    practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
    finds no other advantage in the process but only the
    losing of hope by time.

COUNTESS

    This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
    'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
    almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
    far, would have made nature immortal, and death
    should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
    king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
    the death of the king's disease.

LAFEU

    How called you the man you speak of, madam?

COUNTESS

    He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
    his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

LAFEU

    He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
    lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
    was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
    could be set up against mortality.

BERTRAM

    What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?

LAFEU

    A fistula, my lord.

BERTRAM

    I heard not of it before.

LAFEU

    I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
    the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

COUNTESS

    His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
    her education promises; her dispositions she
    inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
    an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
    commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
    traitors too; in her they are the better for their
    simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

LAFEU

    Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

COUNTESS

    'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
    in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
    her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
    livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
    go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
    a sorrow than have it.

HELENA

    I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

LAFEU

    Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
    excessive grief the enemy to the living.

COUNTESS

    If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
    makes it soon mortal.

BERTRAM

    Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

LAFEU

    How understand we that?

COUNTESS

    Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
    In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
    Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
    Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
    That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
    Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
    Advise him.

LAFEU

    He cannot want the best
    That shall attend his love.

COUNTESS

    Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

    Exit

BERTRAM

    [To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
    your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
    to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.

LAFEU

    Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
    your father.

    Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU

HELENA

    O, were that all! I think not on my father;
    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him: my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone: there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me:
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table; heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

    Enter PAROLLES

    Aside
    One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
    Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
    That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
    Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

PAROLLES

    Save you, fair queen!

HELENA

    And you, monarch!

PAROLLES

    No.

HELENA

    And no.

PAROLLES

    Are you meditating on virginity?

HELENA

    Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
    ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
    may we barricado it against him?

PAROLLES

    Keep him out.

HELENA

    But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
    in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
    warlike resistance.

PAROLLES

    There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
    undermine you and blow you up.

HELENA

    Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
    blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
    virgins might blow up men?

PAROLLES

    Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
    blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
    the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
    is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
    preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
    increase and there was never virgin got till
    virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
    metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
    may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
    ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!

HELENA

    I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

PAROLLES

    There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
    rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
    is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
    disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
    virginity murders itself and should be buried in
    highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
    much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
    paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
    Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
    self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
    by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
    itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
    principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!

HELENA

    How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

PAROLLES

    Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
    likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
    lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
    while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
    Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
    of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
    like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
    now. Your date is better in your pie and your
    porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
    your old virginity, is like one of our French
    withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
    'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
    marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?

HELENA

    Not my virginity yet [ ]
    There shall your master have a thousand loves,
    A mother and a mistress and a friend,
    A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
    His humble ambition, proud humility,
    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
    I know not what he shall. God send him well!
    The court's a learning place, and he is one--

PAROLLES

    What one, i' faith?

HELENA

    That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

PAROLLES

    What's pity?

HELENA

    That wishing well had not a body in't,
    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
    Might with effects of them follow our friends,
    And show what we alone must think, which never
    Return us thanks.

    Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
    will think of thee at court.

HELENA

    Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

PAROLLES

    Under Mars, I.

HELENA

    I especially think, under Mars.

PAROLLES

    Why under Mars?

HELENA

    The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
    be born under Mars.

PAROLLES

    When he was predominant.

HELENA

    When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

PAROLLES

    Why think you so?

HELENA

    You go so much backward when you fight.

PAROLLES

    That's for advantage.

HELENA

    So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
    but the composition that your valour and fear makes
    in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

PAROLLES

    I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
    acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
    which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
    thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
    counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
    thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
    thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
    thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
    none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
    and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

    Exit

HELENA

    Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
    Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
    Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
    So show her merit, that did miss her love?
    The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
    But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

    Exit

SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants 

KING

    The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune and continue
    A braving war.

First Lord

    So 'tis reported, sir.

KING

    Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
    With caution that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business and would seem
    To have us make denial.

First Lord

    His love and wisdom,
    Approved so to your majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.

KING

    He hath arm'd our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes:
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.

Second Lord

    It well may serve
    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.

KING

    What's he comes here?

    Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

First Lord

    It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.

KING

    Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
    Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

BERTRAM

    My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

KING

    I would I had that corporal soundness now,
    As when thy father and myself in friendship
    First tried our soldiership! He did look far
    Into the service of the time and was
    Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
    But on us both did haggish age steal on
    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
    To talk of your good father. In his youth
    He had the wit which I can well observe
    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
    Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
    His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
    Exception bid him speak, and at this time
    His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
    He used as creatures of another place
    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
    Making them proud of his humility,
    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
    Might be a copy to these younger times;
    Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
    But goers backward.

BERTRAM

    His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
    So in approof lives not his epitaph
    As in your royal speech.

KING

    Would I were with him! He would always say--
    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
    To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
    This his good melancholy oft began,
    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
    When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
    I after him do after him wish too,
    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
    To give some labourers room.

Second Lord

    You are loved, sir:
    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

KING

    I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
    Since the physician at your father's died?
    He was much famed.

BERTRAM

    Some six months since, my lord.

KING

    If he were living, I would try him yet.
    Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
    With several applications; nature and sickness
    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
    My son's no dearer.

BERTRAM

    Thank your majesty.

    Exeunt. Flourish

SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown 

COUNTESS

    I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?

Steward

    Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
    wish might be found in the calendar of my past
    endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
    foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
    ourselves we publish them.

COUNTESS

    What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
    the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
    believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
    you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
    enough to make such knaveries yours.

Clown

    'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

COUNTESS

    Well, sir.

Clown

    No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
    many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
    your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
    the woman and I will do as we may.

COUNTESS

    Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

Clown

    I do beg your good will in this case.

COUNTESS

    In what case?

Clown

    In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
    heritage: and I think I shall never have the
    blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
    they say barnes are blessings.

COUNTESS

    Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

Clown

    My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
    by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.

COUNTESS

    Is this all your worship's reason?

Clown

    Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
    are.

COUNTESS

    May the world know them?

Clown

    I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
    all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
    that I may repent.

COUNTESS

    Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

Clown

    I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
    friends for my wife's sake.

COUNTESS

    Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

Clown

    You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
    knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
    He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
    leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
    drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
    of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
    and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
    flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
    my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
    be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
    for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
    Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
    religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
    horns together, like any deer i' the herd.

COUNTESS

    Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?

Clown

    A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
    way:
    For I the ballad will repeat,
    Which men full true shall find;
    Your marriage comes by destiny,
    Your cuckoo sings by kind.

COUNTESS

    Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

Steward

    May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
    you: of her I am to speak.

COUNTESS

    Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
    Helen, I mean.

Clown

    Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
    Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
    Fond done, done fond,
    Was this King Priam's joy?
    With that she sighed as she stood,
    With that she sighed as she stood,
    And gave this sentence then;
    Among nine bad if one be good,
    Among nine bad if one be good,
    There's yet one good in ten.

COUNTESS

    What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.

Clown

    One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
    o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
    the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
    if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
    might have a good woman born but one every blazing
    star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
    well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
    one.

COUNTESS

    You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

Clown

    That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
    hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
    will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
    humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
    going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.

    Exit

COUNTESS

    Well, now.

Steward

    I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

COUNTESS

    Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
    she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
    make title to as much love as she finds: there is
    more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
    her than she'll demand.

Steward

    Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
    she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
    to herself her own words to her own ears; she
    thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
    stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
    Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
    such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
    god, that would not extend his might, only where
    qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
    would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
    rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
    This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
    sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
    held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
    sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
    you something to know it.

COUNTESS

    You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
    yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
    before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
    I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
    leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
    for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.

    Exit Steward

    Enter HELENA
    Even so it was with me when I was young:
    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
    By our remembrances of days foregone,
    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
    Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.

HELENA

    What is your pleasure, madam?

COUNTESS

    You know, Helen,
    I am a mother to you.

HELENA

    Mine honourable mistress.

COUNTESS

    Nay, a mother:
    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
    Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
    That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
    And put you in the catalogue of those
    That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
    Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
    A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
    Yet I express to you a mother's care:
    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
    That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
    Why? that you are my daughter?

HELENA

    That I am not.

COUNTESS

    I say, I am your mother.

HELENA

    Pardon, madam;
    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
    I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
    No note upon my parents, his all noble:
    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
    His servant live, and will his vassal die:
    He must not be my brother.

COUNTESS

    Nor I your mother?

HELENA

    You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
    So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
    Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
    I care no more for than I do for heaven,
    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?

COUNTESS

    Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
    God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
    So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
    My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
    The mystery of your loneliness, and find
    Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
    You love my son; invention is ashamed,
    Against the proclamation of thy passion,
    To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
    That in their kind they speak it: only sin
    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
    If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
    Tell me truly.

HELENA

    Good madam, pardon me!

COUNTESS

    Do you love my son?

HELENA

    Your pardon, noble mistress!

COUNTESS

    Love you my son?

HELENA

    Do not you love him, madam?

COUNTESS

    Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
    Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
    The state of your affection; for your passions
    Have to the full appeach'd.

HELENA

    Then, I confess,
    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
    That before you, and next unto high heaven,
    I love your son.
    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
    Be not offended; for it hurts not him
    That he is loved of me: I follow him not
    By any token of presumptuous suit;
    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
    Yet never know how that desert should be.
    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
    I still pour in the waters of my love
    And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
    Religious in mine error, I adore
    The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
    Let not your hate encounter with my love
    For loving where you do: but if yourself,
    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
    Did ever in so true a flame of liking
    Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
    Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
    To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
    That seeks not to find that her search implies,
    But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

COUNTESS

    Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
    To go to Paris?

HELENA

    Madam, I had.

COUNTESS

    Wherefore? tell true.

HELENA

    I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
    You know my father left me some prescriptions
    Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
    And manifest experience had collected
    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
    As notes whose faculties inclusive were
    More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
    There is a remedy, approved, set down,
    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
    The king is render'd lost.

COUNTESS

    This was your motive
    For Paris, was it? speak.

HELENA

    My lord your son made me to think of this;
    Else Paris and the medicine and the king
    Had from the conversation of my thoughts
    Haply been absent then.

COUNTESS

    But think you, Helen,
    If you should tender your supposed aid,
    He would receive it? he and his physicians
    Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
    They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
    The danger to itself?

HELENA

    There's something in't,
    More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
    Of his profession, that his good receipt
    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
    By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
    But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
    The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
    By such a day and hour.

COUNTESS

    Dost thou believe't?

HELENA

    Ay, madam, knowingly.

COUNTESS

    Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
    Means and attendants and my loving greetings
    To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES 

KING

    Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
    Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
    And is enough for both.

First Lord

    'Tis our hope, sir,
    After well enter'd soldiers, to return
    And find your grace in health.

KING

    No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
    Will not confess he owes the malady
    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
    Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
    Those bated that inherit but the fall
    Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
    That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.

Second Lord

    Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!

KING

    Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
    They say, our French lack language to deny,
    If they demand: beware of being captives,
    Before you serve.

Both

    Our hearts receive your warnings.

KING

    Farewell. Come hither to me.

    Exit, attended

First Lord

    O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

PAROLLES

    'Tis not his fault, the spark.

Second Lord

    O, 'tis brave wars!

PAROLLES

    Most admirable: I have seen those wars.

BERTRAM

    I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
    'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'

PAROLLES

    An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.

BERTRAM

    I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
    Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
    But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

First Lord

    There's honour in the theft.

PAROLLES

    Commit it, count.

Second Lord

    I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

BERTRAM

    I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

First Lord

    Farewell, captain.

Second Lord

    Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

PAROLLES

    Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
    sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
    find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
    Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
    on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
    entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
    reports for me.

First Lord

    We shall, noble captain.

    Exeunt Lords

PAROLLES

    Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

BERTRAM

    Stay: the king.

    Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire

PAROLLES

    [To BERTRAM] Use a more spacious ceremony to the
    noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
    list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
    them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
    time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
    move under the influence of the most received star;
    and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
    be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.

BERTRAM

    And I will do so.

PAROLLES

    Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.

    Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

    Enter LAFEU

LAFEU

    [Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

KING

    I'll fee thee to stand up.

LAFEU

    Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

KING

    I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
    And ask'd thee mercy for't.

LAFEU

    Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
    Will you be cured of your infirmity?

KING

    No.

LAFEU

    O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
    Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
    My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
    That's able to breathe life into a stone,
    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
    And write to her a love-line.

KING

    What 'her' is this?

LAFEU

    Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
    If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
    If seriously I may convey my thoughts
    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
    With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
    Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
    Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
    For that is her demand, and know her business?
    That done, laugh well at me.

KING

    Now, good Lafeu,
    Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
    By wondering how thou took'st it.

LAFEU

    Nay, I'll fit you,
    And not be all day neither.

    Exit

KING

    Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

    Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA

LAFEU

    Nay, come your ways.

KING

    This haste hath wings indeed.

LAFEU

    Nay, come your ways:
    This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
    His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
    That dare leave two together; fare you well.

    Exit

KING

    Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

HELENA

    Ay, my good lord.
    Gerard de Narbon was my father;
    In what he did profess, well found.

KING

    I knew him.

HELENA

    The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
    Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
    Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
    And of his old experience the oily darling,
    He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
    Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
    And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
    With that malignant cause wherein the honour
    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
    I come to tender it and my appliance
    With all bound humbleness.

KING

    We thank you, maiden;
    But may not be so credulous of cure,
    When our most learned doctors leave us and
    The congregated college have concluded
    That labouring art can never ransom nature
    From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
    To prostitute our past-cure malady
    To empirics, or to dissever so
    Our great self and our credit, to esteem
    A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

HELENA

    My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
    I will no more enforce mine office on you.
    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
    A modest one, to bear me back again.

KING

    I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
    As one near death to those that wish him live:
    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

HELENA

    What I can do can do no hurt to try,
    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
    He that of greatest works is finisher
    Oft does them by the weakest minister:
    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
    When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
    From simple sources, and great seas have dried
    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
    Oft expectation fails and most oft there
    Where most it promises, and oft it hits
    Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

KING

    I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
    Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

HELENA

    Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
    It is not so with Him that all things knows
    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
    But most it is presumption in us when
    The help of heaven we count the act of men.
    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
    I am not an impostor that proclaim
    Myself against the level of mine aim;
    But know I think and think I know most sure
    My art is not past power nor you past cure.

KING

    Are thou so confident? within what space
    Hopest thou my cure?

HELENA

    The great'st grace lending grace
    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
    Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

KING

    Upon thy certainty and confidence
    What darest thou venture?

HELENA

    Tax of impudence,
    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
    Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
    Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
    With vilest torture let my life be ended.

KING

    Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
    His powerful sound within an organ weak:
    And what impossibility would slay
    In common sense, sense saves another way.
    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
    That happiness and prime can happy call:
    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
    That ministers thine own death if I die.

HELENA

    If I break time, or flinch in property
    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
    And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
    But, if I help, what do you promise me?

KING

    Make thy demand.

HELENA

    But will you make it even?

KING

    Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

HELENA

    Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
    What husband in thy power I will command:
    Exempted be from me the arrogance
    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
    My low and humble name to propagate
    With any branch or image of thy state;
    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

KING

    Here is my hand; the premises observed,
    Thy will by my performance shall be served:
    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
    Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
    More should I question thee, and more I must,
    Though more to know could not be more to trust,
    From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
    As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

    Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS and Clown 

COUNTESS

    Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
    your breeding.

Clown

    I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
    know my business is but to the court.

COUNTESS

    To the court! why, what place make you special,
    when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

Clown

    Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
    may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
    a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
    has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
    such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
    court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
    men.

COUNTESS

    Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
    questions.

Clown

    It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
    the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
    buttock, or any buttock.

COUNTESS

    Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

Clown

    As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
    as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
    rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
    Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
    hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
    to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
    friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

COUNTESS

    Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
    questions?

Clown

    From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
    will fit any question.

COUNTESS

    It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
    must fit all demands.

Clown

    But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
    should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
    belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
    do you no harm to learn.

COUNTESS

    To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
    pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

Clown

    O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
    more, a hundred of them.

COUNTESS

    Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

COUNTESS

    I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

COUNTESS

    You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! spare not me.

COUNTESS

    Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
    'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
    sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
    to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

Clown

    I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
    sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

COUNTESS

    I play the noble housewife with the time
    To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

COUNTESS

    An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
    And urge her to a present answer back:
    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
    This is not much.

Clown

    Not much commendation to them.

COUNTESS

    Not much employment for you: you understand me?

Clown

    Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

COUNTESS

    Haste you again.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES 

LAFEU

    They say miracles are past; and we have our
    philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
    things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
    we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
    into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
    ourselves to an unknown fear.

PAROLLES

    Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
    shot out in our latter times.

BERTRAM

    And so 'tis.

LAFEU

    To be relinquish'd of the artists,--

PAROLLES

    So I say.

LAFEU

    Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

PAROLLES

    So I say.

LAFEU

    Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--

PAROLLES

    Right; so I say.

LAFEU

    That gave him out incurable,--

PAROLLES

    Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

LAFEU

    Not to be helped,--

PAROLLES

    Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--

LAFEU

    Uncertain life, and sure death.

PAROLLES

    Just, you say well; so would I have said.

LAFEU

    I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

PAROLLES

    It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
    shall read it in--what do you call there?

LAFEU

    A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

PAROLLES

    That's it; I would have said the very same.

LAFEU

    Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
    I speak in respect--

PAROLLES

    Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
    brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
    facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--

LAFEU

    Very hand of heaven.

PAROLLES

    Ay, so I say.

LAFEU

    In a most weak--

    pausing
    and debile minister, great power, great
    transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
    further use to be made than alone the recovery of
    the king, as to be--

    pausing
    generally thankful.

PAROLLES

    I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.

    Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire

LAFEU

    Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
    better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
    able to lead her a coranto.

PAROLLES

    Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?

LAFEU

    'Fore God, I think so.

KING

    Go, call before me all the lords in court.
    Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
    And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
    Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
    The confirmation of my promised gift,
    Which but attends thy naming.

    Enter three or four Lords
    Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
    I have to use: thy frank election make;
    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

HELENA

    To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
    Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

LAFEU

    I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
    And writ as little beard.

KING

    Peruse them well:
    Not one of those but had a noble father.

HELENA

    Gentlemen,
    Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.

All

    We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

HELENA

    I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
    That I protest I simply am a maid.
    Please it your majesty, I have done already:
    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
    We'll ne'er come there again.'

KING

    Make choice; and, see,
    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

HELENA

    Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

First Lord

    And grant it.

HELENA

    Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

LAFEU

    I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
    for my life.

HELENA

    The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
    Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
    Love make your fortunes twenty times above
    Her that so wishes and her humble love!

Second Lord

    No better, if you please.

HELENA

    My wish receive,
    Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

LAFEU

    Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
    I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
    Turk, to make eunuchs of.

HELENA

    Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
    Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

LAFEU

    These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
    sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
    ne'er got 'em.

HELENA

    You are too young, too happy, and too good,
    To make yourself a son out of my blood.

Fourth Lord

    Fair one, I think not so.

LAFEU

    There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
    wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
    of fourteen; I have known thee already.

HELENA

    [To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give
    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
    Into your guiding power. This is the man.

KING

    Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

BERTRAM

    My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
    In such a business give me leave to use
    The help of mine own eyes.

KING

    Know'st thou not, Bertram,
    What she has done for me?

BERTRAM

    Yes, my good lord;
    But never hope to know why I should marry her.

KING

    Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.

BERTRAM

    But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
    She had her breeding at my father's charge.
    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
    Rather corrupt me ever!

KING

    'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
    In differences so mighty. If she be
    All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
    A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
    Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
    The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
    The property by what it is should go,
    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
    In these to nature she's immediate heir,
    And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
    Which challenges itself as honour's born
    And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
    When rather from our acts we them derive
    Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
    Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
    A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
    I can create the rest: virtue and she
    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

BERTRAM

    I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

KING

    Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

HELENA

    That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
    Let the rest go.

KING

    My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
    My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
    We, poising us in her defective scale,
    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
    It is in us to plant thine honour where
    We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
    Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
    Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

BERTRAM

    Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
    My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
    What great creation and what dole of honour
    Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
    Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
    The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
    Is as 'twere born so.

KING

    Take her by the hand,
    And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
    A balance more replete.

BERTRAM

    I take her hand.

KING

    Good fortune and the favour of the king
    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
    And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
    Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

    Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES

LAFEU

    [Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.

PAROLLES

    Your pleasure, sir?

LAFEU

    Your lord and master did well to make his
    recantation.

PAROLLES

    Recantation! My lord! my master!

LAFEU

    Ay; is it not a language I speak?

PAROLLES

    A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
    bloody succeeding. My master!

LAFEU

    Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

PAROLLES

    To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

LAFEU

    To what is count's man: count's master is of
    another style.

PAROLLES

    You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.

LAFEU

    I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
    title age cannot bring thee.

PAROLLES

    What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

LAFEU

    I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
    wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
    travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
    bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
    believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
    have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
    not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
    that thou't scarce worth.

PAROLLES

    Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

LAFEU

    Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
    hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee
    for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
    well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
    through thee. Give me thy hand.

PAROLLES

    My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

LAFEU

    Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

PAROLLES

    I have not, my lord, deserved it.

LAFEU

    Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
    bate thee a scruple.

PAROLLES

    Well, I shall be wiser.

LAFEU

    Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
    a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
    in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
    to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
    my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
    that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.

PAROLLES

    My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

LAFEU

    I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
    doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
    thee, in what motion age will give me leave.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
    me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
    be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
    I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
    any convenience, an he were double and double a
    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
    would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.

    Re-enter LAFEU

LAFEU

    Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news
    for you: you have a new mistress.

PAROLLES

    I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
    some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
    lord: whom I serve above is my master.

LAFEU

    Who? God?

PAROLLES

    Ay, sir.

LAFEU

    The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
    garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
    sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
    thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
    honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
    thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
    every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
    created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

PAROLLES

    This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

LAFEU

    Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
    kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
    no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
    and honourable personages than the commission of your
    birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
    worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
    let it be concealed awhile.

    Re-enter BERTRAM

BERTRAM

    Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

PAROLLES

    What's the matter, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM

    Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
    I will not bed her.

PAROLLES

    What, what, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM

    O my Parolles, they have married me!
    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

PAROLLES

    France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
    The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

BERTRAM

    There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
    I know not yet.

PAROLLES

    Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
    He wears his honour in a box unseen,
    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
    Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
    Therefore, to the war!

BERTRAM

    It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
    And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
    That which I durst not speak; his present gift
    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
    Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
    To the dark house and the detested wife.

PAROLLES

    Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

BERTRAM

    Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
    I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

PAROLLES

    Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
    A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
    The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Enter HELENA and Clown 

HELENA

    My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

Clown

    She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
    very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
    given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
    world; but yet she is not well.

HELENA

    If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
    not very well?

Clown

    Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

HELENA

    What two things?

Clown

    One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
    quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
    God send her quickly!

    Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES

    Bless you, my fortunate lady!

HELENA

    I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
    good fortunes.

PAROLLES

    You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
    on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

Clown

    So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
    I would she did as you say.

PAROLLES

    Why, I say nothing.

Clown

    Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
    tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
    nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
    nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
    is within a very little of nothing.

PAROLLES

    Away! thou'rt a knave.

Clown

    You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
    knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
    been truth, sir.

PAROLLES

    Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

Clown

    Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
    taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
    and much fool may you find in you, even to the
    world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

PAROLLES

    A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
    Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
    A very serious business calls on him.
    The great prerogative and rite of love,
    Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
    But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
    Which they distil now in the curbed time,
    To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
    And pleasure drown the brim.

HELENA

    What's his will else?

PAROLLES

    That you will take your instant leave o' the king
    And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
    Strengthen'd with what apology you think
    May make it probable need.

HELENA

    What more commands he?

PAROLLES

    That, having this obtain'd, you presently
    Attend his further pleasure.

HELENA

    In every thing I wait upon his will.

PAROLLES

    I shall report it so.

HELENA

    I pray you.

    Exit PAROLLES
    Come, sirrah.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM 

LAFEU

    But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

BERTRAM

    Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

LAFEU

    You have it from his own deliverance.

BERTRAM

    And by other warranted testimony.

LAFEU

    Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.

BERTRAM

    I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
    knowledge and accordingly valiant.

LAFEU

    I have then sinned against his experience and
    transgressed against his valour; and my state that
    way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
    heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
    us friends; I will pursue the amity.

    Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES

    [To BERTRAM] These things shall be done, sir.

LAFEU

    Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

PAROLLES

    Sir?

LAFEU

    O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
    workman, a very good tailor.

BERTRAM

    [Aside to PAROLLES] Is she gone to the king?

PAROLLES

    She is.

BERTRAM

    Will she away to-night?

PAROLLES

    As you'll have her.

BERTRAM

    I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
    Given order for our horses; and to-night,
    When I should take possession of the bride,
    End ere I do begin.

LAFEU

    A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
    dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a
    known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
    be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.

BERTRAM

    Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

PAROLLES

    I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
    displeasure.

LAFEU

    You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
    and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and
    out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
    question for your residence.

BERTRAM

    It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

LAFEU

    And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
    prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
    of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
    soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
    matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
    tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
    I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
    deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    An idle lord. I swear.

BERTRAM

    I think so.

PAROLLES

    Why, do you not know him?

BERTRAM

    Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
    Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

    Enter HELENA

HELENA

    I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
    Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
    For present parting; only he desires
    Some private speech with you.

BERTRAM

    I shall obey his will.
    You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
    The ministration and required office
    On my particular. Prepared I was not
    For such a business; therefore am I found
    So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
    That presently you take our way for home;
    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
    For my respects are better than they seem
    And my appointments have in them a need
    Greater than shows itself at the first view
    To you that know them not. This to my mother:

    Giving a letter
    'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
    I leave you to your wisdom.

HELENA

    Sir, I can nothing say,
    But that I am your most obedient servant.

BERTRAM

    Come, come, no more of that.

HELENA

    And ever shall
    With true observance seek to eke out that
    Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
    To equal my great fortune.

BERTRAM

    Let that go:
    My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

HELENA

    Pray, sir, your pardon.

BERTRAM

    Well, what would you say?

HELENA

    I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
    What law does vouch mine own.

BERTRAM

    What would you have?

HELENA

    Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
    I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
    Faith yes;
    Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

BERTRAM

    I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

HELENA

    I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

BERTRAM

    Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.

    Exit HELENA
    Go thou toward home; where I will never come
    Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
    Away, and for our flight.

PAROLLES

    Bravely, coragio!

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Florence. The DUKE's palace.

    Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers. 

DUKE

    So that from point to point now have you heard
    The fundamental reasons of this war,
    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
    And more thirsts after.

First Lord

    Holy seems the quarrel
    Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
    On the opposer.

DUKE

    Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
    Would in so just a business shut his bosom
    Against our borrowing prayers.

Second Lord

    Good my lord,
    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
    But like a common and an outward man,
    That the great figure of a council frames
    By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
    Say what I think of it, since I have found
    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
    As often as I guess'd.

DUKE

    Be it his pleasure.

First Lord

    But I am sure the younger of our nature,
    That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
    Come here for physic.

DUKE

    Welcome shall they be;
    And all the honours that can fly from us
    Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
    When better fall, for your avails they fell:
    To-morrow to the field.

    Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS and Clown 

COUNTESS

    It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
    that he comes not along with her.

Clown

    By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
    melancholy man.

COUNTESS

    By what observance, I pray you?

Clown

    Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
    ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
    teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
    melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

COUNTESS

    Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

    Opening a letter

Clown

    I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
    old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
    like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
    the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
    love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

COUNTESS

    What have we here?

Clown

    E'en that you have there.

    Exit

COUNTESS

    [Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
    recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
    her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
    eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
    before the report come. If there be breadth enough
    in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
    to you. Your unfortunate son,
    BERTRAM.
    This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
    To fly the favours of so good a king;
    To pluck his indignation on thy head
    By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
    For the contempt of empire.

    Re-enter Clown

Clown

    O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
    soldiers and my young lady!

COUNTESS

    What is the matter?

Clown

    Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
    comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
    thought he would.

COUNTESS

    Why should he be killed?

Clown

    So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
    the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
    men, though it be the getting of children. Here
    they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
    hear your son was run away.

    Exit

    Enter HELENA, and two Gentlemen

First Gentleman

    Save you, good madam.

HELENA

    Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

Second Gentleman

    Do not say so.

COUNTESS

    Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
    I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
    That the first face of neither, on the start,
    Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

Second Gentleman

    Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
    Thither we bend again.

HELENA

    Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

    Reads
    When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
    of thy body that I am father to, then call me
    husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
    This is a dreadful sentence.

COUNTESS

    Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

First Gentleman

    Ay, madam;
    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.

COUNTESS

    I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
    If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
    Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
    But I do wash his name out of my blood,
    And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

Second Gentleman

    Ay, madam.

COUNTESS

    And to be a soldier?

Second Gentleman

    Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
    The duke will lay upon him all the honour
    That good convenience claims.

COUNTESS

    Return you thither?

First Gentleman

    Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

HELENA

    [Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
    'Tis bitter.

COUNTESS

    Find you that there?

HELENA

    Ay, madam.

First Gentleman

    'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
    heart was not consenting to.

COUNTESS

    Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
    There's nothing here that is too good for him
    But only she; and she deserves a lord
    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
    And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

First Gentleman

    A servant only, and a gentleman
    Which I have sometime known.

COUNTESS

    Parolles, was it not?

First Gentleman

    Ay, my good lady, he.

COUNTESS

    A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
    My son corrupts a well-derived nature
    With his inducement.

First Gentleman

    Indeed, good lady,
    The fellow has a deal of that too much,
    Which holds him much to have.

COUNTESS

    You're welcome, gentlemen.
    I will entreat you, when you see my son,
    To tell him that his sword can never win
    The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
    Written to bear along.

Second Gentleman

    We serve you, madam,
    In that and all your worthiest affairs.

COUNTESS

    Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
    Will you draw near!

    Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen

HELENA

    'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
    Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
    That chase thee from thy country and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected: better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
    My being here it is that holds thee hence:
    Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house
    And angels officed all: I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

    Exit

SCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.

    Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets 

DUKE

    The general of our horse thou art; and we,
    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
    Upon thy promising fortune.

BERTRAM

    Sir, it is
    A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
    To the extreme edge of hazard.

DUKE

    Then go thou forth;
    And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
    As thy auspicious mistress!

BERTRAM

    This very day,
    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
    Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS and Steward 

COUNTESS

    Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
    Might you not know she would do as she has done,
    By sending me a letter? Read it again.

Steward

    [Reads]
    I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
    Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
    That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
    With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
    Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
    His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
    His taken labours bid him me forgive;
    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
    He is too good and fair for death and me:
    Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

COUNTESS

    Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
    As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
    I could have well diverted her intents,
    Which thus she hath prevented.

Steward

    Pardon me, madam:
    If I had given you this at over-night,
    She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,
    Pursuit would be but vain.

COUNTESS

    What angel shall
    Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
    He will return; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    Led hither by pure love: which of them both
    Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
    To make distinction: provide this messenger:
    My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.

    Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other Citizens 

Widow

    Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we
    shall lose all the sight.

DIANA

    They say the French count has done most honourable service.

Widow

    It is reported that he has taken their greatest
    commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
    duke's brother.

    Tucket
    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
    way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.

MARIANA

    Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
    the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
    French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
    no legacy is so rich as honesty.

Widow

    I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
    by a gentleman his companion.

MARIANA

    I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
    filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
    young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
    enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
    lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
    hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
    example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
    maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
    but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
    them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
    I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
    though there were no further danger known but the
    modesty which is so lost.

DIANA

    You shall not need to fear me.

Widow

    I hope so.

    Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim
    Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
    my house; thither they send one another: I'll
    question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

HELENA

    To Saint Jaques le Grand.
    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

Widow

    At the Saint Francis here beside the port.

HELENA

    Is this the way?

Widow

    Ay, marry, is't.

    A march afar
    Hark you! they come this way.
    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
    But till the troops come by,
    I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
    The rather, for I think I know your hostess
    As ample as myself.

HELENA

    Is it yourself?

Widow

    If you shall please so, pilgrim.

HELENA

    I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

Widow

    You came, I think, from France?

HELENA

    I did so.

Widow

    Here you shall see a countryman of yours
    That has done worthy service.

HELENA

    His name, I pray you.

DIANA

    The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

HELENA

    But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
    His face I know not.

DIANA

    Whatsome'er he is,
    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
    As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
    Against his liking: think you it is so?

HELENA

    Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

DIANA

    There is a gentleman that serves the count
    Reports but coarsely of her.

HELENA

    What's his name?

DIANA

    Monsieur Parolles.

HELENA

    O, I believe with him,
    In argument of praise, or to the worth
    Of the great count himself, she is too mean
    To have her name repeated: all her deserving
    Is a reserved honesty, and that
    I have not heard examined.

DIANA

    Alas, poor lady!
    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
    Of a detesting lord.

Widow

    I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
    Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
    A shrewd turn, if she pleased.

HELENA

    How do you mean?
    May be the amorous count solicits her
    In the unlawful purpose.

Widow

    He does indeed;
    And brokes with all that can in such a suit
    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
    But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
    In honestest defence.

MARIANA

    The gods forbid else!

Widow

    So, now they come:

    Drum and Colours

    Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army
    That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
    That, Escalus.

HELENA

    Which is the Frenchman?

DIANA

    He;
    That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
    I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
    He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

HELENA

    I like him well.

DIANA

    'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
    That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
    I would Poison that vile rascal.

HELENA

    Which is he?

DIANA

    That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?

HELENA

    Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

PAROLLES

    Lose our drum! well.

MARIANA

    He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.

Widow

    Marry, hang you!

MARIANA

    And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

    Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army

Widow

    The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
    Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
    Already at my house.

HELENA

    I humbly thank you:
    Please it this matron and this gentle maid
    To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
    Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
    Worthy the note.

BOTH

    We'll take your offer kindly.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.

    Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords 

Second Lord

    Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
    way.

First Lord

    If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
    more in your respect.

Second Lord

    On my life, my lord, a bubble.

BERTRAM

    Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

Second Lord

    Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
    without any malice, but to speak of him as my
    kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
    endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
    of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
    entertainment.

First Lord

    It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
    his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
    great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.

BERTRAM

    I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

First Lord

    None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
    which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.

Second Lord

    I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
    surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
    knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
    him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
    is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
    present at his examination: if he do not, for the
    promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
    base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
    intelligence in his power against you, and that with
    the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
    trust my judgment in any thing.

First Lord

    O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
    he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
    lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
    what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
    melted, if you give him not John Drum's
    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
    Here he comes.

    Enter PAROLLES

Second Lord

    [Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,
    hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
    off his drum in any hand.

BERTRAM

    How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
    disposition.

First Lord

    A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

PAROLLES

    'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
    There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
    horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!

First Lord

    That was not to be blamed in the command of the
    service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
    himself could not have prevented, if he had been
    there to command.

BERTRAM

    Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
    dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
    not to be recovered.

PAROLLES

    It might have been recovered.

BERTRAM

    It might; but it is not now.

PAROLLES

    It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
    service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
    performer, I would have that drum or another, or
    'hic jacet.'

BERTRAM

    Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
    think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
    instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
    be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
    grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
    speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
    and extend to you what further becomes his
    greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
    worthiness.

PAROLLES

    By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

BERTRAM

    But you must not now slumber in it.

PAROLLES

    I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
    pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
    certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
    and by midnight look to hear further from me.

BERTRAM

    May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

PAROLLES

    I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
    the attempt I vow.

BERTRAM

    I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
    thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

PAROLLES

    I love not many words.

    Exit

Second Lord

    No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
    strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
    to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
    be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
    damned than to do't?

First Lord

    You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
    is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
    for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
    when you find him out, you have him ever after.

BERTRAM

    Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
    this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

Second Lord

    None in the world; but return with an invention and
    clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
    have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
    to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

First Lord

    We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
    him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
    when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
    sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
    very night.

Second Lord

    I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

BERTRAM

    Your brother he shall go along with me.

Second Lord

    As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

    Exit

BERTRAM

    Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
    The lass I spoke of.

First Lord

    But you say she's honest.

BERTRAM

    That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
    By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
    Will you go see her?

First Lord

    With all my heart, my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.

    Enter HELENA and Widow 

HELENA

    If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
    I know not how I shall assure you further,
    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

Widow

    Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
    Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
    And would not put my reputation now
    In any staining act.

HELENA

    Nor would I wish you.
    First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
    And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
    Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
    By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
    Err in bestowing it.

Widow

    I should believe you:
    For you have show'd me that which well approves
    You're great in fortune.

HELENA

    Take this purse of gold,
    And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
    Which I will over-pay and pay again
    When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
    Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
    Now his important blood will nought deny
    That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
    That downward hath succeeded in his house
    From son to son, some four or five descents
    Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
    In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
    Howe'er repented after.

Widow

    Now I see
    The bottom of your purpose.

HELENA

    You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
    Herself most chastely absent: after this,
    To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
    To what is passed already.

Widow

    I have yielded:
    Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
    That time and place with this deceit so lawful
    May prove coherent. Every night he comes
    With musics of all sorts and songs composed
    To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
    To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
    As if his life lay on't.

HELENA

    Why then to-night
    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
    And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
    But let's about it.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.

    Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush 

Second Lord

    He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
    language you will: though you understand it not
    yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
    understand him, unless some one among us whom we
    must produce for an interpreter.

First Soldier

    Good captain, let me be the interpreter.

Second Lord

    Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?

First Soldier

    No, sir, I warrant you.

Second Lord

    But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?

First Soldier

    E'en such as you speak to me.

Second Lord

    He must think us some band of strangers i' the
    adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
    all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
    one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
    speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
    know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
    gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
    interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
    ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
    and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

    Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES

    Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
    time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
    done? It must be a very plausive invention that
    carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
    have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
    my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
    fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
    daring the reports of my tongue.

Second Lord

    This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
    was guilty of.

PAROLLES

    What the devil should move me to undertake the
    recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
    impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
    must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
    exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
    will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
    ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
    instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
    butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

Second Lord

    Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
    that he is?

PAROLLES

    I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
    turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.

Second Lord

    We cannot afford you so.

PAROLLES

    Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
    stratagem.

Second Lord

    'Twould not do.

PAROLLES

    Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.

Second Lord

    Hardly serve.

PAROLLES

    Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.

Second Lord

    How deep?

PAROLLES

    Thirty fathom.

Second Lord

    Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.

PAROLLES

    I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
    I recovered it.

Second Lord

    You shall hear one anon.

PAROLLES

    A drum now of the enemy's,--

    Alarum within

Second Lord

    Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.

All

    Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.

PAROLLES

    O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.

    They seize and blindfold him

First Soldier

    Boskos thromuldo boskos.

PAROLLES

    I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
    And I shall lose my life for want of language;
    If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
    Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
    Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

First Soldier

    Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
    thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
    faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.

PAROLLES

    O!

First Soldier

    O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.

Second Lord

    Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

First Soldier

    The general is content to spare thee yet;
    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
    To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
    Something to save thy life.

PAROLLES

    O, let me live!
    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
    Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
    Which you will wonder at.

First Soldier

    But wilt thou faithfully?

PAROLLES

    If I do not, damn me.

First Soldier

    Acordo linta.
    Come on; thou art granted space.

    Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within

Second Lord

    Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,
    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
    Till we do hear from them.

Second Soldier

    Captain, I will.

Second Lord

    A' will betray us all unto ourselves:
    Inform on that.

Second Soldier

    So I will, sir.

Second Lord

    Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.

    Enter BERTRAM and DIANA 

BERTRAM

    They told me that your name was Fontibell.

DIANA

    No, my good lord, Diana.

BERTRAM

    Titled goddess;
    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
    In your fine frame hath love no quality?
    If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
    You are no maiden, but a monument:
    When you are dead, you should be such a one
    As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
    And now you should be as your mother was
    When your sweet self was got.

DIANA

    She then was honest.

BERTRAM

    So should you be.

DIANA

    No:
    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
    As you owe to your wife.

BERTRAM

    No more o' that;
    I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
    I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
    Do thee all rights of service.

DIANA

    Ay, so you serve us
    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
    And mock us with our bareness.

BERTRAM

    How have I sworn!

DIANA

    'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
    But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
    If I should swear by God's great attributes,
    I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
    To swear by him whom I protest to love,
    That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
    At least in my opinion.

BERTRAM

    Change it, change it;
    Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
    But give thyself unto my sick desires,
    Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
    My love as it begins shall so persever.

DIANA

    I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

BERTRAM

    I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
    To give it from me.

DIANA

    Will you not, my lord?

BERTRAM

    It is an honour 'longing to our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
    In me to lose.

DIANA

    Mine honour's such a ring:
    My chastity's the jewel of our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
    In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
    Against your vain assault.

BERTRAM

    Here, take my ring:
    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
    And I'll be bid by thee.

DIANA

    When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
    And on your finger in the night I'll put
    Another ring, that what in time proceeds
    May token to the future our past deeds.
    Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

BERTRAM

    A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

    Exit

DIANA

    For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
    You may so in the end.
    My mother told me just how he would woo,
    As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
    Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
    Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
    Only in this disguise I think't no sin
    To cozen him that would unjustly win.

    Exit

SCENE III. The Florentine camp.

    Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers 

First Lord

    You have not given him his mother's letter?

Second Lord

    I have delivered it an hour since: there is
    something in't that stings his nature; for on the
    reading it he changed almost into another man.

First Lord

    He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
    off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.

Second Lord

    Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
    displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
    bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
    thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.

First Lord

    When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
    grave of it.

Second Lord

    He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
    Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
    fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
    given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
    made in the unchaste composition.

First Lord

    Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
    what things are we!

Second Lord

    Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
    of all treasons, we still see them reveal
    themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
    so he that in this action contrives against his own
    nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.

First Lord

    Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
    our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
    company to-night?

Second Lord

    Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.

First Lord

    That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
    his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
    of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
    set this counterfeit.

Second Lord

    We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
    presence must be the whip of the other.

First Lord

    In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?

Second Lord

    I hear there is an overture of peace.

First Lord

    Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

Second Lord

    What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
    higher, or return again into France?

First Lord

    I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
    of his council.

Second Lord

    Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
    of his act.

First Lord

    Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
    house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
    le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
    sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
    tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
    grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
    now she sings in heaven.

Second Lord

    How is this justified?

First Lord

    The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
    makes her story true, even to the point of her
    death: her death itself, which could not be her
    office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
    the rector of the place.

Second Lord

    Hath the count all this intelligence?

First Lord

    Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
    point, so to the full arming of the verity.

Second Lord

    I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.

First Lord

    How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!

Second Lord

    And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
    in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
    here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
    with a shame as ample.

First Lord

    The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
    ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
    faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
    despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.

    Enter a Messenger
    How now! where's your master?

Servant

    He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
    taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
    morning for France. The duke hath offered him
    letters of commendations to the king.

Second Lord

    They shall be no more than needful there, if they
    were more than they can commend.

First Lord

    They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
    Here's his lordship now.

    Enter BERTRAM
    How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?

BERTRAM

    I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
    month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
    I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
    nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
    lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
    and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
    many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
    that I have not ended yet.

Second Lord

    If the business be of any difficulty, and this
    morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
    your lordship.

BERTRAM

    I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
    hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
    dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
    bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
    me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

Second Lord

    Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
    poor gallant knave.

BERTRAM

    No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
    his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

Second Lord

    I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
    him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
    he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
    hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
    to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
    this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
    stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?

BERTRAM

    Nothing of me, has a'?

Second Lord

    His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
    face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
    are, you must have the patience to hear it.

    Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier

BERTRAM

    A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
    me: hush, hush!

First Lord

    Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa

First Soldier

    He calls for the tortures: what will you say
    without 'em?

PAROLLES

    I will confess what I know without constraint: if
    ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

First Soldier

    Bosko chimurcho.

First Lord

    Boblibindo chicurmurco.

First Soldier

    You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.

PAROLLES

    And truly, as I hope to live.

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse the
    duke is strong.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES

    Five or six thousand; but very weak and
    unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
    the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
    and credit and as I hope to live.

First Soldier

    Shall I set down your answer so?

PAROLLES

    Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.

BERTRAM

    All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

First Lord

    You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
    Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
    phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
    knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
    his dagger.

Second Lord

    I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
    clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
    by wearing his apparel neatly.

First Soldier

    Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES

    Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
    true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.

First Lord

    He's very near the truth in this.

BERTRAM

    But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
    delivers it.

PAROLLES

    Poor rogues, I pray you, say.

First Soldier

    Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES

    I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
    rogues are marvellous poor.

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are
    a-foot.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES

    By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
    hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
    hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
    many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
    and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
    fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
    sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
    poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
    their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.

BERTRAM

    What shall be done to him?

First Lord

    Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
    condition, and what credit I have with the duke.

First Soldier

    Well, that's set down.

    Reads
    'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
    be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
    with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
    expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
    possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
    corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
    do you know of it?

PAROLLES

    I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
    the inter'gatories: demand them singly.

First Soldier

    Do you know this Captain Dumain?

PAROLLES

    I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
    from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
    fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
    say him nay.

BERTRAM

    Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
    his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

First Soldier

    Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?

PAROLLES

    Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

First Lord

    Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
    lordship anon.

First Soldier

    What is his reputation with the duke?

PAROLLES

    The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
    of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
    out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.

First Soldier

    Marry, we'll search.

PAROLLES

    In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
    or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
    in my tent.

First Soldier

    Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?

PAROLLES

    I do not know if it be it or no.

BERTRAM

    Our interpreter does it well.

First Lord

    Excellently.

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--

PAROLLES

    That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
    Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
    Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
    ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.

First Soldier

    Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.

PAROLLES

    My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
    behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
    a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
    virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.

BERTRAM

    Damnable both-sides rogue!

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he never pays the score:
    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
    For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
    Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
    PAROLLES.'

BERTRAM

    He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
    in's forehead.

Second Lord

    This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
    linguist and the armipotent soldier.

BERTRAM

    I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
    he's a cat to me.

First Soldier

    I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
    fain to hang you.

PAROLLES

    My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
    die; but that, my offences being many, I would
    repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
    sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.

First Soldier

    We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
    have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
    his valour: what is his honesty?

PAROLLES

    He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
    rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
    professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
    is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
    such volubility, that you would think truth were a
    fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
    be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
    harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
    know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
    little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
    every thing that an honest man should not have; what
    an honest man should have, he has nothing.

First Lord

    I begin to love him for this.

BERTRAM

    For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
    him for me, he's more and more a cat.

First Soldier

    What say you to his expertness in war?

PAROLLES

    Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
    tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
    his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
    he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
    called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
    files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
    this I am not certain.

First Lord

    He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
    rarity redeems him.

BERTRAM

    A pox on him, he's a cat still.

First Soldier

    His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.

PAROLLES

    Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
    of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
    entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
    succession for it perpetually.

First Soldier

    What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?

Second Lord

    Why does be ask him of me?

First Soldier

    What's he?

PAROLLES

    E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
    great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
    deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
    yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
    in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
    on he has the cramp.

First Soldier

    If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
    the Florentine?

PAROLLES

    Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.

First Soldier

    I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.

PAROLLES

    [Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
    drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
    beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
    the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
    would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?

First Soldier

    There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
    general says, you that have so traitorously
    discovered the secrets of your army and made such
    pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
    serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
    must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.

PAROLLES

    O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!

First Lord

    That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.

    Unblinding him
    So, look about you: know you any here?

BERTRAM

    Good morrow, noble captain.

Second Lord

    God bless you, Captain Parolles.

First Lord

    God save you, noble captain.

Second Lord

    Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
    I am for France.

First Lord

    Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
    an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
    but fare you well.

    Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords

First Soldier

    You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
    has a knot on't yet

PAROLLES

    Who cannot be crushed with a plot?

First Soldier

    If you could find out a country where but women were
    that had received so much shame, you might begin an
    impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
    too: we shall speak of you there.

    Exit with Soldiers

PAROLLES

    Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
    But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
    As captain shall: simply the thing I am
    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
    Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
    that every braggart shall be found an ass.
    Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
    Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
    There's place and means for every man alive.
    I'll after them.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.

    Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA 

HELENA

    That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
    One of the greatest in the Christian world
    Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
    Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
    Time was, I did him a desired office,
    Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
    Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
    And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
    His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
    We have convenient convoy. You must know
    I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
    My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
    And by the leave of my good lord the king,
    We'll be before our welcome.

Widow

    Gentle madam,
    You never had a servant to whose trust
    Your business was more welcome.

HELENA

    Nor you, mistress,
    Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
    To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
    Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
    As it hath fated her to be my motive
    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
    When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
    Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
    With what it loathes for that which is away.
    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
    Something in my behalf.

DIANA

    Let death and honesty
    Go with your impositions, I am yours
    Upon your will to suffer.

HELENA

    Yet, I pray you:
    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
    Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:
    All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;
    Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown 

LAFEU

    No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
    fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
    made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
    his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
    this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
    by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

COUNTESS

    I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
    most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
    praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
    flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
    could not have owed her a more rooted love.

LAFEU

    'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
    thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.

Clown

    Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
    salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

LAFEU

    They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.

Clown

    I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
    skill in grass.

LAFEU

    Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?

Clown

    A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.

LAFEU

    Your distinction?

Clown

    I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.

LAFEU

    So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

Clown

    And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.

LAFEU

    I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.

Clown

    At your service.

LAFEU

    No, no, no.

Clown

    Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
    great a prince as you are.

LAFEU

    Who's that? a Frenchman?

Clown

    Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
    is more hotter in France than there.

LAFEU

    What prince is that?

Clown

    The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
    darkness; alias, the devil.

LAFEU

    Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
    to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
    serve him still.

Clown

    I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
    great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
    good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
    world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
    the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
    too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
    themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
    tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
    leads to the broad gate and the great fire.

LAFEU

    Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
    tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
    with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
    looked to, without any tricks.

Clown

    If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
    jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.

    Exit

LAFEU

    A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

COUNTESS

    So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
    sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
    which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
    indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.

LAFEU

    I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
    tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
    that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
    moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
    my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
    his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
    first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
    it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
    conceived against your son, there is no fitter
    matter. How does your ladyship like it?

COUNTESS

    With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
    happily effected.

LAFEU

    His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
    body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
    to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
    intelligence hath seldom failed.

COUNTESS

    It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
    die. I have letters that my son will be here
    to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
    with me till they meet together.

LAFEU

    Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
    safely be admitted.

COUNTESS

    You need but plead your honourable privilege.

LAFEU

    Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
    thank my God it holds yet.

    Re-enter Clown

Clown

    O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
    velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
    or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
    velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
    half, but his right cheek is worn bare.

LAFEU

    A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
    of honour; so belike is that.

Clown

    But it is your carbonadoed face.

LAFEU

    Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
    with the young noble soldier.

Clown

    Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
    hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
    and nod at every man.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.

    Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA, with two Attendants 

HELENA

    But this exceeding posting day and night
    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
    But since you have made the days and nights as one,
    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
    Be bold you do so grow in my requital
    As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

    Enter a Gentleman
    This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
    If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

Gentleman

    And you.

HELENA

    Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

Gentleman

    I have been sometimes there.

HELENA

    I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
    From the report that goes upon your goodness;
    An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
    Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
    The use of your own virtues, for the which
    I shall continue thankful.

Gentleman

    What's your will?

HELENA

    That it will please you
    To give this poor petition to the king,
    And aid me with that store of power you have
    To come into his presence.

Gentleman

    The king's not here.

HELENA

    Not here, sir!

Gentleman

    Not, indeed:
    He hence removed last night and with more haste
    Than is his use.

Widow

    Lord, how we lose our pains!

HELENA

    ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
    Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
    I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

Gentleman

    Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
    Whither I am going.

HELENA

    I do beseech you, sir,
    Since you are like to see the king before me,
    Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
    Which I presume shall render you no blame
    But rather make you thank your pains for it.
    I will come after you with what good speed
    Our means will make us means.

Gentleman

    This I'll do for you.

HELENA

    And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
    Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
    Go, go, provide.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.

    Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following 

PAROLLES

    Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this
    letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to
    you, when I have held familiarity with fresher
    clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's
    mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
    displeasure.

Clown

    Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
    smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
    henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
    Prithee, allow the wind.

PAROLLES

    Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake
    but by a metaphor.

Clown

    Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
    nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
    thee further.

PAROLLES

    Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

Clown

    Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
    close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
    comes himself.

    Enter LAFEU
    Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
    cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
    unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
    says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
    carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
    ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
    distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
    your lordship.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
    scratched.

LAFEU

    And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to
    pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the
    knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
    of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves
    thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for
    you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:
    I am for other business.

PAROLLES

    I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.

LAFEU

    You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;
    save your word.

PAROLLES

    My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

LAFEU

    You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!
    give me your hand. How does your drum?

PAROLLES

    O my good lord, you were the first that found me!

LAFEU

    Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.

PAROLLES

    It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,
    for you did bring me out.

LAFEU

    Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once
    both the office of God and the devil? One brings
    thee in grace and the other brings thee out.

    Trumpets sound
    The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,
    inquire further after me; I had talk of you last
    night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall
    eat; go to, follow.

PAROLLES

    I praise God for you.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants 

KING

    We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
    Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
    As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
    Her estimation home.

COUNTESS

    'Tis past, my liege;
    And I beseech your majesty to make it
    Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
    O'erbears it and burns on.

KING

    My honour'd lady,
    I have forgiven and forgotten all;
    Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
    And watch'd the time to shoot.

LAFEU

    This I must say,
    But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
    Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
    Offence of mighty note; but to himself
    The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
    Whose beauty did astonish the survey
    Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
    Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
    Humbly call'd mistress.

KING

    Praising what is lost
    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
    We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
    All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
    The nature of his great offence is dead,
    And deeper than oblivion we do bury
    The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
    A stranger, no offender; and inform him
    So 'tis our will he should.

Gentleman

    I shall, my liege.

    Exit

KING

    What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?

LAFEU

    All that he is hath reference to your highness.

KING

    Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
    That set him high in fame.

    Enter BERTRAM

LAFEU

    He looks well on't.

KING

    I am not a day of season,
    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
    In me at once: but to the brightest beams
    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
    The time is fair again.

BERTRAM

    My high-repented blames,
    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

KING

    All is whole;
    Not one word more of the consumed time.
    Let's take the instant by the forward top;
    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
    The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
    The daughter of this lord?

BERTRAM

    Admiringly, my liege, at first
    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
    Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
    Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
    Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
    Extended or contracted all proportions
    To a most hideous object: thence it came
    That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
    Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
    The dust that did offend it.

KING

    Well excused:
    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
    From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
    To the great sender turns a sour offence,
    Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
    Make trivial price of serious things we have,
    Not knowing them until we know their grave:
    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
    Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
    While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
    Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
    To see our widower's second marriage-day.

COUNTESS

    Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

LAFEU

    Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
    Must be digested, give a favour from you
    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
    That she may quickly come.

    BERTRAM gives a ring
    By my old beard,
    And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
    Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
    The last that e'er I took her at court,
    I saw upon her finger.

BERTRAM

    Hers it was not.

KING

    Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
    This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
    Necessitied to help, that by this token
    I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
    her
    Of what should stead her most?

BERTRAM

    My gracious sovereign,
    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
    The ring was never hers.

COUNTESS

    Son, on my life,
    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
    At her life's rate.

LAFEU

    I am sure I saw her wear it.

BERTRAM

    You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
    Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
    I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
    To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
    I could not answer in that course of honour
    As she had made the overture, she ceased
    In heavy satisfaction and would never
    Receive the ring again.

KING

    Plutus himself,
    That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
    Hath not in nature's mystery more science
    Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
    That you are well acquainted with yourself,
    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
    You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
    That she would never put it from her finger,
    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
    Where you have never come, or sent it us
    Upon her great disaster.

BERTRAM

    She never saw it.

KING

    Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
    And makest conjectural fears to come into me
    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
    That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
    And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
    More than to see this ring. Take him away.

    Guards seize BERTRAM
    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
    We'll sift this matter further.

BERTRAM

    If you shall prove
    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
    Where yet she never was.

    Exit, guarded

KING

    I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

    Enter a Gentleman

Gentleman

    Gracious sovereign,
    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,
    Who hath for four or five removes come short
    To tender it herself. I undertook it,
    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
    Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
    Is here attending: her business looks in her
    With an importing visage; and she told me,
    In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
    Your highness with herself.

KING

    [Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me
    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
    me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
    are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
    stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
    him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
    king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
    flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
    DIANA CAPILET.

LAFEU

    I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
    this: I'll none of him.

KING

    The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
    To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
    Go speedily and bring again the count.
    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
    Was foully snatch'd.

COUNTESS

    Now, justice on the doers!

    Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded

KING

    I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
    Yet you desire to marry.

    Enter Widow and DIANA
    What woman's that?

DIANA

    I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
    Derived from the ancient Capilet:
    My suit, as I do understand, you know,
    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

Widow

    I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
    And both shall cease, without your remedy.

KING

    Come hither, count; do you know these women?

BERTRAM

    My lord, I neither can nor will deny
    But that I know them: do they charge me further?

DIANA

    Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

BERTRAM

    She's none of mine, my lord.

DIANA

    If you shall marry,
    You give away this hand, and that is mine;
    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
    You give away myself, which is known mine;
    For I by vow am so embodied yours,
    That she which marries you must marry me,
    Either both or none.

LAFEU

    Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
    are no husband for her.

BERTRAM

    My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
    Than for to think that I would sink it here.

KING

    Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
    Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
    Than in my thought it lies.

DIANA

    Good my lord,
    Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
    He had not my virginity.

KING

    What say'st thou to her?

BERTRAM

    She's impudent, my lord,
    And was a common gamester to the camp.

DIANA

    He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
    He might have bought me at a common price:
    Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
    Whose high respect and rich validity
    Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
    He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
    If I be one.

COUNTESS

    He blushes, and 'tis it:
    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
    Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
    Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
    That ring's a thousand proofs.

KING

    Methought you said
    You saw one here in court could witness it.

DIANA

    I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
    So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

LAFEU

    I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

KING

    Find him, and bring him hither.

    Exit an Attendant

BERTRAM

    What of him?
    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
    With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
    That will speak any thing?

KING

    She hath that ring of yours.

BERTRAM

    I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
    And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
    She knew her distance and did angle for me,
    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
    As all impediments in fancy's course
    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
    Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
    Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
    And I had that which any inferior might
    At market-price have bought.

DIANA

    I must be patient:
    You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
    May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
    Send for your ring, I will return it home,
    And give me mine again.

BERTRAM

    I have it not.

KING

    What ring was yours, I pray you?

DIANA

    Sir, much like
    The same upon your finger.

KING

    Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

DIANA

    And this was it I gave him, being abed.

KING

    The story then goes false, you threw it him
    Out of a casement.

DIANA

    I have spoke the truth.

    Enter PAROLLES

BERTRAM

    My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

KING

    You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
    Is this the man you speak of?

DIANA

    Ay, my lord.

KING

    Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
    Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
    By him and by this woman here what know you?

PAROLLES

    So please your majesty, my master hath been an
    honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
    which gentlemen have.

KING

    Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

PAROLLES

    Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

KING

    How, I pray you?

PAROLLES

    He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

KING

    How is that?

PAROLLES

    He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

KING

    As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
    equivocal companion is this!

PAROLLES

    I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

LAFEU

    He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

DIANA

    Do you know he promised me marriage?

PAROLLES

    Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

KING

    But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

PAROLLES

    Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
    as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
    indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
    of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
    was in that credit with them at that time that I
    knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
    as promising her marriage, and things which would
    derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
    speak what I know.

KING

    Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
    they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
    evidence; therefore stand aside.
    This ring, you say, was yours?

DIANA

    Ay, my good lord.

KING

    Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

DIANA

    It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

KING

    Who lent it you?

DIANA

    It was not lent me neither.

KING

    Where did you find it, then?

DIANA

    I found it not.

KING

    If it were yours by none of all these ways,
    How could you give it him?

DIANA

    I never gave it him.

LAFEU

    This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
    and on at pleasure.

KING

    This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

DIANA

    It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

KING

    Take her away; I do not like her now;
    To prison with her: and away with him.
    Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
    Thou diest within this hour.

DIANA

    I'll never tell you.

KING

    Take her away.

DIANA

    I'll put in bail, my liege.

KING

    I think thee now some common customer.

DIANA

    By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

KING

    Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

DIANA

    Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
    Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

KING

    She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

DIANA

    Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

    Exit Widow
    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
    Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
    He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
    And at that time he got his wife with child:
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
    And now behold the meaning.

    Re-enter Widow, with HELENA

KING

    Is there no exorcist
    Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
    Is't real that I see?

HELENA

    No, my good lord;
    'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
    The name and not the thing.

BERTRAM

    Both, both. O, pardon!

HELENA

    O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
    I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
    And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
    'When from my finger you can get this ring
    And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:
    Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

BERTRAM

    If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
    I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

HELENA

    If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
    Deadly divorce step between me and you!
    O my dear mother, do I see you living?

LAFEU

    Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

    To PAROLLES
    Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
    I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
    Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

KING

    Let us from point to point this story know,
    To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

    To DIANA
    If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
    Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
    For I can guess that by thy honest aid
    Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
    Of that and all the progress, more or less,
    Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
    All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
    The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

    EPILOGUE

KING

    The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
    All is well ended, if this suit be won,
    That you express content; which we will pay,
    With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
    Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
    Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.

    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM 

ORLANDO

    As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
    bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
    and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
    blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
    sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
    he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
    properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
    that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
    differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
    are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
    with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
    and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
    brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
    which his animals on his dunghills are as much
    bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
    plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
    me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
    me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
    gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
    grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
    think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
    servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
    know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

ADAM

    Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ORLANDO

    Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
    shake me up.

    Enter OLIVER

OLIVER

    Now, sir! what make you here?

ORLANDO

    Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.

OLIVER

    What mar you then, sir?

ORLANDO

    Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
    made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

OLIVER

    Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

ORLANDO

    Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
    What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
    come to such penury?

OLIVER

    Know you where your are, sir?

ORLANDO

    O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.

OLIVER

    Know you before whom, sir?

ORLANDO

    Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
    you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
    condition of blood, you should so know me. The
    courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
    you are the first-born; but the same tradition
    takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
    betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
    you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
    nearer to his reverence.

OLIVER

    What, boy!

ORLANDO

    Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

OLIVER

    Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

ORLANDO

    I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
    Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
    a villain that says such a father begot villains.
    Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
    from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
    tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.

ADAM

    Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
    remembrance, be at accord.

OLIVER

    Let me go, I say.

ORLANDO

    I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
    father charged you in his will to give me good
    education: you have trained me like a peasant,
    obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
    qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
    me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
    me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
    give me the poor allottery my father left me by
    testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.

OLIVER

    And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
    Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
    with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
    pray you, leave me.

ORLANDO

    I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

OLIVER

    Get you with him, you old dog.

ADAM

    Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
    teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
    he would not have spoke such a word.

    Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER

    Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
    physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
    crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!

    Enter DENNIS

DENNIS

    Calls your worship?

OLIVER

    Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

DENNIS

    So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
    access to you.

OLIVER

    Call him in.

    Exit DENNIS
    'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.

    Enter CHARLES

CHARLES

    Good morrow to your worship.

OLIVER

    Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
    new court?

CHARLES

    There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
    that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
    brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
    have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
    whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

OLIVER

    Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
    banished with her father?

CHARLES

    O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
    her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
    that she would have followed her exile, or have died
    to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
    less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
    never two ladies loved as they do.

OLIVER

    Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES

    They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
    a many merry men with him; and there they live like
    the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
    gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
    carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

OLIVER

    What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

CHARLES

    Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
    matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
    that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
    to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
    To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
    escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
    well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
    for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
    must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
    out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
    withal, that either you might stay him from his
    intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
    run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
    and altogether against my will.

OLIVER

    Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
    thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
    myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
    have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
    it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
    it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
    of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
    good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
    me his natural brother: therefore use thy
    discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
    as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
    thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
    mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
    against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
    treacherous device and never leave thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
    for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
    it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
    day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
    should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
    blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES

    I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
    to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
    alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
    so God keep your worship!

OLIVER

    Farewell, good Charles.

    Exit CHARLES
    Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
    an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
    hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
    schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
    all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
    in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
    people, who best know him, that I am altogether
    misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
    wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
    I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

    Exit

SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.

    Enter CELIA and ROSALIND 

CELIA

    I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND

    Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
    and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
    teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
    learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA

    Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
    that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
    had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
    hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
    love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
    if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
    tempered as mine is to thee.

ROSALIND

    Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.

CELIA

    You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
    like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
    be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
    father perforce, I will render thee again in
    affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
    that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
    sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

ROSALIND

    From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
    me see; what think you of falling in love?

CELIA

    Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
    love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
    neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
    in honour come off again.

ROSALIND

    What shall be our sport, then?

CELIA

    Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
    her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

ROSALIND

    I would we could do so, for her benefits are
    mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
    doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

CELIA

    'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
    makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
    makes very ill-favouredly.

ROSALIND

    Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
    Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
    not in the lineaments of Nature.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA

    No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
    not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
    hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
    Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND

    Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
    Nature's wit.

CELIA

    Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
    Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
    to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
    natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
    the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
    wit! whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE

    Mistress, you must come away to your father.

CELIA

    Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE

    No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

ROSALIND

    Where learned you that oath, fool?

TOUCHSTONE

    Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
    were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
    mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
    pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
    yet was not the knight forsworn.

CELIA

    How prove you that, in the great heap of your
    knowledge?

ROSALIND

    Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

TOUCHSTONE

    Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
    swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA

    By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE

    By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
    swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
    more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
    never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
    before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

CELIA

    Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE

    One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

CELIA

    My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
    speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
    one of these days.

TOUCHSTONE

    The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
    wise men do foolishly.

CELIA

    By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
    wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
    that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
    Monsieur Le Beau.

ROSALIND

    With his mouth full of news.

CELIA

    Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.

ROSALIND

    Then shall we be news-crammed.

CELIA

    All the better; we shall be the more marketable.

    Enter LE BEAU
    Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?

LE BEAU

    Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

CELIA

    Sport! of what colour?

LE BEAU

    What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND

    As wit and fortune will.

TOUCHSTONE

    Or as the Destinies decree.

CELIA

    Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

TOUCHSTONE

    Nay, if I keep not my rank,--

ROSALIND

    Thou losest thy old smell.

LE BEAU

    You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

ROSALIND

    You tell us the manner of the wrestling.

LE BEAU

    I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
    your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
    yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
    to perform it.

CELIA

    Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

LE BEAU

    There comes an old man and his three sons,--

CELIA

    I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU

    Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND

    With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
    by these presents.'

LE BEAU

    The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
    duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
    and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
    hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
    so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
    their father, making such pitiful dole over them
    that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

ROSALIND

    Alas!

TOUCHSTONE

    But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
    have lost?

LE BEAU

    Why, this that I speak of.

TOUCHSTONE

    Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
    time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
    for ladies.

CELIA

    Or I, I promise thee.

ROSALIND

    But is there any else longs to see this broken music
    in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
    rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

LE BEAU

    You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
    perform it.

CELIA

    Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

    Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants

DUKE FREDERICK

    Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
    own peril on his forwardness.

ROSALIND

    Is yonder the man?

LE BEAU

    Even he, madam.

CELIA

    Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.

DUKE FREDERICK

    How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
    to see the wrestling?

ROSALIND

    Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.

DUKE FREDERICK

    You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
    there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
    challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
    will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
    you can move him.

CELIA

    Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Do so: I'll not be by.

LE BEAU

    Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.

ORLANDO

    I attend them with all respect and duty.

ROSALIND

    Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO

    No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
    come but in, as others do, to try with him the
    strength of my youth.

CELIA

    Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
    years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
    strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
    knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
    adventure would counsel you to a more equal
    enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
    embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

ROSALIND

    Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
    be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
    that the wrestling might not go forward.

ORLANDO

    I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
    thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
    so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
    your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
    trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
    shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
    dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
    friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
    world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
    the world I fill up a place, which may be better
    supplied when I have made it empty.

ROSALIND

    The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.

CELIA

    And mine, to eke out hers.

ROSALIND

    Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!

CELIA

    Your heart's desires be with you!

CHARLES

    Come, where is this young gallant that is so
    desirous to lie with his mother earth?

ORLANDO

    Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.

DUKE FREDERICK

    You shall try but one fall.

CHARLES

    No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
    to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
    from a first.

ORLANDO

    An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
    mocked me before: but come your ways.

ROSALIND

    Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

CELIA

    I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
    fellow by the leg.

    They wrestle

ROSALIND

    O excellent young man!

CELIA

    If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
    should down.

    Shout. CHARLES is thrown

DUKE FREDERICK

    No more, no more.

ORLANDO

    Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.

DUKE FREDERICK

    How dost thou, Charles?

LE BEAU

    He cannot speak, my lord.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?

ORLANDO

    Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

DUKE FREDERICK

    I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
    But I did find him still mine enemy:
    Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
    Hadst thou descended from another house.
    But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
    I would thou hadst told me of another father.

    Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU

CELIA

    Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

ORLANDO

    I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
    His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
    To be adopted heir to Frederick.

ROSALIND

    My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
    And all the world was of my father's mind:
    Had I before known this young man his son,
    I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
    Ere he should thus have ventured.

CELIA

    Gentle cousin,
    Let us go thank him and encourage him:
    My father's rough and envious disposition
    Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
    If you do keep your promises in love
    But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
    Your mistress shall be happy.

ROSALIND

    Gentleman,

    Giving him a chain from her neck
    Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
    That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
    Shall we go, coz?

CELIA

    Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.

ORLANDO

    Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
    Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

ROSALIND

    He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
    I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
    Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
    More than your enemies.

CELIA

    Will you go, coz?

ROSALIND

    Have with you. Fare you well.

    Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

ORLANDO

    What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
    I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.

    Re-enter LE BEAU

LE BEAU

    Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
    To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
    High commendation, true applause and love,
    Yet such is now the duke's condition
    That he misconstrues all that you have done.
    The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
    More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.

ORLANDO

    I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
    Which of the two was daughter of the duke
    That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU

    Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
    But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
    The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
    And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
    To keep his daughter company; whose loves
    Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
    But I can tell you that of late this duke
    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
    Grounded upon no other argument
    But that the people praise her for her virtues
    And pity her for her good father's sake;
    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
    Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
    Hereafter, in a better world than this,
    I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

ORLANDO

    I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

    Exit LE BEAU
    Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
    From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
    But heavenly Rosalind!

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in the palace.

    Enter CELIA and ROSALIND 

CELIA

    Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?

ROSALIND

    Not one to throw at a dog.

CELIA

    No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
    curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.

ROSALIND

    Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
    should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
    without any.

CELIA

    But is all this for your father?

ROSALIND

    No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
    full of briers is this working-day world!

CELIA

    They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
    holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
    paths our very petticoats will catch them.

ROSALIND

    I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.

CELIA

    Hem them away.

ROSALIND

    I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.

CELIA

    Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

ROSALIND

    O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!

CELIA

    O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
    despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
    service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
    possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
    strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

ROSALIND

    The duke my father loved his father dearly.

CELIA

    Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
    dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
    for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
    not Orlando.

ROSALIND

    No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

CELIA

    Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?

ROSALIND

    Let me love him for that, and do you love him
    because I do. Look, here comes the duke.

CELIA

    With his eyes full of anger.

    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK

    Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
    And get you from our court.

ROSALIND

    Me, uncle?

DUKE FREDERICK

    You, cousin
    Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
    So near our public court as twenty miles,
    Thou diest for it.

ROSALIND

    I do beseech your grace,
    Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
    If with myself I hold intelligence
    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
    If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
    As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
    Never so much as in a thought unborn
    Did I offend your highness.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Thus do all traitors:
    If their purgation did consist in words,
    They are as innocent as grace itself:
    Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

ROSALIND

    Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
    Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.

ROSALIND

    So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
    So was I when your highness banish'd him:
    Treason is not inherited, my lord;
    Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
    What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
    Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
    To think my poverty is treacherous.

CELIA

    Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
    Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA

    I did not then entreat to have her stay;
    It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
    I was too young that time to value her;
    But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
    Why so am I; we still have slept together,
    Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
    And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
    Still we went coupled and inseparable.

DUKE FREDERICK

    She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
    Her very silence and her patience
    Speak to the people, and they pity her.
    Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
    And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
    When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
    Firm and irrevocable is my doom
    Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.

CELIA

    Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
    I cannot live out of her company.

DUKE FREDERICK

    You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
    And in the greatness of my word, you die.

    Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords

CELIA

    O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
    Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
    I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

ROSALIND

    I have more cause.

CELIA

    Thou hast not, cousin;
    Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

ROSALIND

    That he hath not.

CELIA

    No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
    Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
    No: let my father seek another heir.
    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
    Whither to go and what to bear with us;
    And do not seek to take your change upon you,
    To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

ROSALIND

    Why, whither shall we go?

CELIA

    To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

ROSALIND

    Alas, what danger will it be to us,
    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

CELIA

    I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
    The like do you: so shall we pass along
    And never stir assailants.

ROSALIND

    Were it not better,
    Because that I am more than common tall,
    That I did suit me all points like a man?
    A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
    A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
    As many other mannish cowards have
    That do outface it with their semblances.

CELIA

    What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

ROSALIND

    I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
    But what will you be call'd?

CELIA

    Something that hath a reference to my state
    No longer Celia, but Aliena.

ROSALIND

    But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
    The clownish fool out of your father's court?
    Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

CELIA

    He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
    Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
    And get our jewels and our wealth together,
    Devise the fittest time and safest way
    To hide us from pursuit that will be made
    After my flight. Now go we in content
    To liberty and not to banishment.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.

    Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters 

DUKE SENIOR

    Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
    Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
    More free from peril than the envious court?
    Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
    The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
    'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    And this our life exempt from public haunt
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
    Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
    I would not change it.

AMIENS

    Happy is your grace,
    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

DUKE SENIOR

    Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
    And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
    Being native burghers of this desert city,
    Should in their own confines with forked heads
    Have their round haunches gored.

First Lord

    Indeed, my lord,
    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
    To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
    Did steal behind him as he lay along
    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
    To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
    Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
    The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
    Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
    Coursed one another down his innocent nose
    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
    Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
    Augmenting it with tears.

DUKE SENIOR

    But what said Jaques?
    Did he not moralize this spectacle?

First Lord

    O, yes, into a thousand similes.
    First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
    'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
    To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
    Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
    ''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
    The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
    And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
    'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
    Thus most invectively he pierceth through
    The body of the country, city, court,
    Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
    Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
    To fright the animals and to kill them up
    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.

DUKE SENIOR

    And did you leave him in this contemplation?

Second Lord

    We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
    Upon the sobbing deer.

DUKE SENIOR

    Show me the place:
    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
    For then he's full of matter.

First Lord

    I'll bring you to him straight.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the palace.

    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords 

DUKE FREDERICK

    Can it be possible that no man saw them?
    It cannot be: some villains of my court
    Are of consent and sufferance in this.

First Lord

    I cannot hear of any that did see her.
    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
    Saw her abed, and in the morning early
    They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.

Second Lord

    My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
    Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
    Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
    Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
    Your daughter and her cousin much commend
    The parts and graces of the wrestler
    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
    And she believes, wherever they are gone,
    That youth is surely in their company.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
    If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
    I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
    And let not search and inquisition quail
    To bring again these foolish runaways.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.

    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting 

ORLANDO

    Who's there?

ADAM

    What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
    O my sweet master! O you memory
    Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
    Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
    And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
    Why would you be so fond to overcome
    The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
    Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
    Know you not, master, to some kind of men
    Their graces serve them but as enemies?
    No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
    O, what a world is this, when what is comely
    Envenoms him that bears it!

ORLANDO

    Why, what's the matter?

ADAM

    O unhappy youth!
    Come not within these doors; within this roof
    The enemy of all your graces lives:
    Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
    Yet not the son, I will not call him son
    Of him I was about to call his father--
    Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
    To burn the lodging where you use to lie
    And you within it: if he fail of that,
    He will have other means to cut you off.
    I overheard him and his practises.
    This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

ORLANDO

    Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM

    No matter whither, so you come not here.

ORLANDO

    What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
    Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
    A thievish living on the common road?
    This I must do, or know not what to do:
    Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
    I rather will subject me to the malice
    Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

ADAM

    But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
    The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
    When service should in my old limbs lie lame
    And unregarded age in corners thrown:
    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
    Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
    And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
    For in my youth I never did apply
    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
    Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
    The means of weakness and debility;
    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
    Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
    I'll do the service of a younger man
    In all your business and necessities.

ORLANDO

    O good old man, how well in thee appears
    The constant service of the antique world,
    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
    Where none will sweat but for promotion,
    And having that, do choke their service up
    Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
    But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
    That cannot so much as a blossom yield
    In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
    But come thy ways; well go along together,
    And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
    We'll light upon some settled low content.

ADAM

    Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
    To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
    From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
    Here lived I, but now live here no more.
    At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
    But at fourscore it is too late a week:
    Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.

    Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE 

ROSALIND

    O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!

TOUCHSTONE

    I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.

ROSALIND

    I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
    apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
    the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
    itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
    good Aliena!

CELIA

    I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.

TOUCHSTONE

    For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear
    you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
    for I think you have no money in your purse.

ROSALIND

    Well, this is the forest of Arden.

TOUCHSTONE

    Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was
    at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
    must be content.

ROSALIND

    Ay, be so, good Touchstone.

    Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
    Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in
    solemn talk.

CORIN

    That is the way to make her scorn you still.

SILVIUS

    O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!

CORIN

    I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.

SILVIUS

    No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
    Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
    As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
    But if thy love were ever like to mine--
    As sure I think did never man love so--
    How many actions most ridiculous
    Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

CORIN

    Into a thousand that I have forgotten.

SILVIUS

    O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
    If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
    That ever love did make thee run into,
    Thou hast not loved:
    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
    Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
    Thou hast not loved:
    Or if thou hast not broke from company
    Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
    Thou hast not loved.
    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!

    Exit

ROSALIND

    Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
    I have by hard adventure found mine own.

TOUCHSTONE

    And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
    my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
    coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
    kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
    pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
    wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
    two cods and, giving her them again, said with
    weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
    true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
    mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.

ROSALIND

    Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.

TOUCHSTONE

    Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
    break my shins against it.

ROSALIND

    Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
    Is much upon my fashion.

TOUCHSTONE

    And mine; but it grows something stale with me.

CELIA

    I pray you, one of you question yond man
    If he for gold will give us any food:
    I faint almost to death.

TOUCHSTONE

    Holla, you clown!

ROSALIND

    Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.

CORIN

    Who calls?

TOUCHSTONE

    Your betters, sir.

CORIN

    Else are they very wretched.

ROSALIND

    Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.

CORIN

    And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

ROSALIND

    I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
    Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
    Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
    Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
    And faints for succor.

CORIN

    Fair sir, I pity her
    And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
    My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
    But I am shepherd to another man
    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
    My master is of churlish disposition
    And little recks to find the way to heaven
    By doing deeds of hospitality:
    Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
    Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
    By reason of his absence, there is nothing
    That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
    And in my voice most welcome shall you be.

ROSALIND

    What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN

    That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
    That little cares for buying any thing.

ROSALIND

    I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
    Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
    And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

CELIA

    And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
    And willingly could waste my time in it.

CORIN

    Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
    Go with me: if you like upon report
    The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
    I will your very faithful feeder be
    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The Forest.

    Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others 

    SONG.

AMIENS

    Under the greenwood tree
    Who loves to lie with me,
    And turn his merry note
    Unto the sweet bird's throat,
    Come hither, come hither, come hither:
    Here shall he see No enemy
    But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES

    More, more, I prithee, more.

AMIENS

    It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES

    I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
    melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
    More, I prithee, more.

AMIENS

    My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.

JAQUES

    I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
    sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?

AMIENS

    What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES

    Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
    nothing. Will you sing?

AMIENS

    More at your request than to please myself.

JAQUES

    Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
    but that they call compliment is like the encounter
    of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
    methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
    the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
    not, hold your tongues.

AMIENS

    Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
    duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
    this day to look you.

JAQUES

    And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
    too disputable for my company: I think of as many
    matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
    boast of them. Come, warble, come.
    SONG.
    Who doth ambition shun

    All together here
    And loves to live i' the sun,
    Seeking the food he eats
    And pleased with what he gets,
    Come hither, come hither, come hither:
    Here shall he see No enemy
    But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES

    I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
    yesterday in despite of my invention.

AMIENS

    And I'll sing it.

JAQUES

    Thus it goes:--
    If it do come to pass
    That any man turn ass,
    Leaving his wealth and ease,
    A stubborn will to please,
    Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
    Here shall he see
    Gross fools as he,
    An if he will come to me.

AMIENS

    What's that 'ducdame'?

JAQUES

    'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
    circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
    rail against all the first-born of Egypt.

AMIENS

    And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE VI. The forest.

    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM 

ADAM

    Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
    Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
    kind master.

ORLANDO

    Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
    a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
    If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
    will either be food for it or bring it for food to
    thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
    For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
    the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
    and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
    give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
    come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
    thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
    Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
    thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
    lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
    desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. The forest.

    A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws 

DUKE SENIOR

    I think he be transform'd into a beast;
    For I can no where find him like a man.

First Lord

    My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

DUKE SENIOR

    If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
    Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

    Enter JAQUES

First Lord

    He saves my labour by his own approach.

DUKE SENIOR

    Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
    That your poor friends must woo your company?
    What, you look merrily!

JAQUES

    A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
    A motley fool; a miserable world!
    As I do live by food, I met a fool
    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
    In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
    And then he drew a dial from his poke,
    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
    The motley fool thus moral on the time,
    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
    That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
    And I did laugh sans intermission
    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR

    What fool is this?

JAQUES

    O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
    They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
    With observation, the which he vents
    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
    I am ambitious for a motley coat.

DUKE SENIOR

    Thou shalt have one.

JAQUES

    It is my only suit;
    Provided that you weed your better judgments
    Of all opinion that grows rank in them
    That I am wise. I must have liberty
    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
    To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
    And they that are most galled with my folly,
    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
    The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
    He that a fool doth very wisely hit
    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
    Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
    The wise man's folly is anatomized
    Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
    Invest me in my motley; give me leave
    To speak my mind, and I will through and through
    Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
    If they will patiently receive my medicine.

DUKE SENIOR

    Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

JAQUES

    What, for a counter, would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR

    Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
    And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
    That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

JAQUES

    Why, who cries out on pride,
    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the weary very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name,
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not of my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?

    Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn

ORLANDO

    Forbear, and eat no more.

JAQUES

    Why, I have eat none yet.

ORLANDO

    Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.

JAQUES

    Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR

    Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?

ORLANDO

    You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
    Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
    He dies that touches any of this fruit
    Till I and my affairs are answered.

JAQUES

    An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.

DUKE SENIOR

    What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
    More than your force move us to gentleness.

ORLANDO

    I almost die for food; and let me have it.

DUKE SENIOR

    Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

ORLANDO

    Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
    I thought that all things had been savage here;
    And therefore put I on the countenance
    Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
    That in this desert inaccessible,
    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
    If ever you have look'd on better days,
    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
    If ever sat at any good man's feast,
    If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

DUKE SENIOR

    True is it that we have seen better days,
    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
    And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
    Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
    And therefore sit you down in gentleness
    And take upon command what help we have
    That to your wanting may be minister'd.

ORLANDO

    Then but forbear your food a little while,
    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
    And give it food. There is an old poor man,
    Who after me hath many a weary step
    Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
    I will not touch a bit.

DUKE SENIOR

    Go find him out,
    And we will nothing waste till you return.

ORLANDO

    I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!

    Exit

DUKE SENIOR

    Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
    This wide and universal theatre
    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
    Wherein we play in.

JAQUES

    All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players:
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
    And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lined,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

    Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR

    Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
    And let him feed.

ORLANDO

    I thank you most for him.

ADAM

    So had you need:
    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR

    Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
    As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
    Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
    SONG.

AMIENS

    Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
    Thou art not so unkind
    As man's ingratitude;
    Thy tooth is not so keen,
    Because thou art not seen,
    Although thy breath be rude.
    Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
    Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
    Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
    This life is most jolly.
    Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
    That dost not bite so nigh
    As benefits forgot:
    Though thou the waters warp,
    Thy sting is not so sharp
    As friend remember'd not.
    Heigh-ho! sing, & c.

DUKE SENIOR

    If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
    Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
    That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
    Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
    And let me all your fortunes understand.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the palace.

    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER 

DUKE FREDERICK

    Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
    But were I not the better part made mercy,
    I should not seek an absent argument
    Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
    Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
    Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
    Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
    To seek a living in our territory.
    Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
    Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
    Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
    Of what we think against thee.

OLIVER

    O that your highness knew my heart in this!
    I never loved my brother in my life.

DUKE FREDERICK

    More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
    And let my officers of such a nature
    Make an extent upon his house and lands:
    Do this expediently and turn him going.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The forest.

    Enter ORLANDO, with a paper 

ORLANDO

    Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
    And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
    That every eye which in this forest looks
    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
    The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.

    Exit

    Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CORIN

    And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
    life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
    it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
    like it very well; but in respect that it is
    private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
    is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
    respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
    is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
    but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
    against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?

CORIN

    No more but that I know the more one sickens the
    worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
    means and content is without three good friends;
    that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
    burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
    he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
    complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.

TOUCHSTONE

    Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
    court, shepherd?

CORIN

    No, truly.

TOUCHSTONE

    Then thou art damned.

CORIN

    Nay, I hope.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
    on one side.

CORIN

    For not being at court? Your reason.

TOUCHSTONE

    Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
    good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
    then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
    sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
    state, shepherd.

CORIN

    Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
    at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
    behavior of the country is most mockable at the
    court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
    you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
    uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.

TOUCHSTONE

    Instance, briefly; come, instance.

CORIN

    Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
    fells, you know, are greasy.

TOUCHSTONE

    Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
    the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
    a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.

CORIN

    Besides, our hands are hard.

TOUCHSTONE

    Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
    A more sounder instance, come.

CORIN

    And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
    our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
    courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.

TOUCHSTONE

    Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
    good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
    perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
    very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.

CORIN

    You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.

TOUCHSTONE

    Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
    God make incision in thee! thou art raw.

CORIN

    Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
    that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
    happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
    harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
    graze and my lambs suck.

TOUCHSTONE

    That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
    and the rams together and to offer to get your
    living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
    bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
    twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
    out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
    damned for this, the devil himself will have no
    shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
    'scape.

CORIN

    Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

    Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading

ROSALIND

    From the east to western Ind,
    No jewel is like Rosalind.
    Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
    Through all the world bears Rosalind.
    All the pictures fairest lined
    Are but black to Rosalind.
    Let no fair be kept in mind
    But the fair of Rosalind.

TOUCHSTONE

    I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
    suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
    right butter-women's rank to market.

ROSALIND

    Out, fool!

TOUCHSTONE

    For a taste:
    If a hart do lack a hind,
    Let him seek out Rosalind.
    If the cat will after kind,
    So be sure will Rosalind.
    Winter garments must be lined,
    So must slender Rosalind.
    They that reap must sheaf and bind;
    Then to cart with Rosalind.
    Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
    Such a nut is Rosalind.
    He that sweetest rose will find
    Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
    This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
    infect yourself with them?

ROSALIND

    Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

ROSALIND

    I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
    with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
    i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
    ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.

TOUCHSTONE

    You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
    forest judge.

    Enter CELIA, with a writing

ROSALIND

    Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.

CELIA

    [Reads]
    Why should this a desert be?
    For it is unpeopled? No:
    Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
    That shall civil sayings show:
    Some, how brief the life of man
    Runs his erring pilgrimage,
    That the stretching of a span
    Buckles in his sum of age;
    Some, of violated vows
    'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
    But upon the fairest boughs,
    Or at every sentence end,
    Will I Rosalinda write,
    Teaching all that read to know
    The quintessence of every sprite
    Heaven would in little show.
    Therefore Heaven Nature charged
    That one body should be fill'd
    With all graces wide-enlarged:
    Nature presently distill'd
    Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
    Cleopatra's majesty,
    Atalanta's better part,
    Sad Lucretia's modesty.
    Thus Rosalind of many parts
    By heavenly synod was devised,
    Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
    To have the touches dearest prized.
    Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
    And I to live and die her slave.

ROSALIND

    O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
    have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
    cried 'Have patience, good people!'

CELIA

    How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
    Go with him, sirrah.

TOUCHSTONE

    Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
    though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.

    Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CELIA

    Didst thou hear these verses?

ROSALIND

    O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
    them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.

CELIA

    That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.

ROSALIND

    Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
    themselves without the verse and therefore stood
    lamely in the verse.

CELIA

    But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
    should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

ROSALIND

    I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
    before you came; for look here what I found on a
    palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
    Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
    can hardly remember.

CELIA

    Trow you who hath done this?

ROSALIND

    Is it a man?

CELIA

    And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
    Change you colour?

ROSALIND

    I prithee, who?

CELIA

    O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
    meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
    and so encounter.

ROSALIND

    Nay, but who is it?

CELIA

    Is it possible?

ROSALIND

    Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
    tell me who it is.

CELIA

    O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
    wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
    out of all hooping!

ROSALIND

    Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
    caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
    my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
    South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
    quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
    stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
    out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
    mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
    all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
    may drink thy tidings.

CELIA

    So you may put a man in your belly.

ROSALIND

    Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
    head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?

CELIA

    Nay, he hath but a little beard.

ROSALIND

    Why, God will send more, if the man will be
    thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
    thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.

CELIA

    It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
    heels and your heart both in an instant.

ROSALIND

    Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
    true maid.

CELIA

    I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

ROSALIND

    Orlando?

CELIA

    Orlando.

ROSALIND

    Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
    hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
    he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
    him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
    How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
    him again? Answer me in one word.

CELIA

    You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
    word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
    say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
    answer in a catechism.

ROSALIND

    But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
    man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
    day he wrestled?

CELIA

    It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
    finding him, and relish it with good observance.
    I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.

ROSALIND

    It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
    forth such fruit.

CELIA

    Give me audience, good madam.

ROSALIND

    Proceed.

CELIA

    There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.

ROSALIND

    Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
    becomes the ground.

CELIA

    Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
    unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.

ROSALIND

    O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.

CELIA

    I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
    me out of tune.

ROSALIND

    Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
    speak. Sweet, say on.

CELIA

    You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?

    Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

ROSALIND

    'Tis he: slink by, and note him.

JAQUES

    I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
    as lief have been myself alone.

ORLANDO

    And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
    too for your society.

JAQUES

    God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.

ORLANDO

    I do desire we may be better strangers.

JAQUES

    I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
    love-songs in their barks.

ORLANDO

    I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
    them ill-favouredly.

JAQUES

    Rosalind is your love's name?

ORLANDO

    Yes, just.

JAQUES

    I do not like her name.

ORLANDO

    There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
    christened.

JAQUES

    What stature is she of?

ORLANDO

    Just as high as my heart.

JAQUES

    You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
    acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
    out of rings?

ORLANDO

    Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
    whence you have studied your questions.

JAQUES

    You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
    Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
    we two will rail against our mistress the world and
    all our misery.

ORLANDO

    I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
    against whom I know most faults.

JAQUES

    The worst fault you have is to be in love.

ORLANDO

    'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
    I am weary of you.

JAQUES

    By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
    you.

ORLANDO

    He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
    shall see him.

JAQUES

    There I shall see mine own figure.

ORLANDO

    Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.

JAQUES

    I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
    Signior Love.

ORLANDO

    I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
    Melancholy.

    Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND

    [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy
    lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
    Do you hear, forester?

ORLANDO

    Very well: what would you?

ROSALIND

    I pray you, what is't o'clock?

ORLANDO

    You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
    in the forest.

ROSALIND

    Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
    sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
    detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.

ORLANDO

    And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
    been as proper?

ROSALIND

    By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
    divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
    withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
    withal and who he stands still withal.

ORLANDO

    I prithee, who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND

    Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
    contract of her marriage and the day it is
    solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
    Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
    seven year.

ORLANDO

    Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND

    With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
    hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
    he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
    he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
    and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
    of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.

ORLANDO

    Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND

    With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
    softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.

ORLANDO

    Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND

    With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
    term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.

ORLANDO

    Where dwell you, pretty youth?

ROSALIND

    With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
    skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.

ORLANDO

    Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND

    As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.

ORLANDO

    Your accent is something finer than you could
    purchase in so removed a dwelling.

ROSALIND

    I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
    religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
    in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
    too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
    him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
    I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
    giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
    whole sex withal.

ORLANDO

    Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
    laid to the charge of women?

ROSALIND

    There were none principal; they were all like one
    another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
    monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.

ORLANDO

    I prithee, recount some of them.

ROSALIND

    No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
    are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
    abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
    their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
    on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
    Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
    give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
    quotidian of love upon him.

ORLANDO

    I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
    your remedy.

ROSALIND

    There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
    taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
    of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.

ORLANDO

    What were his marks?

ROSALIND

    A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
    sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
    spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
    which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
    simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
    revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
    bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
    untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
    careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
    are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
    loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.

ORLANDO

    Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.

ROSALIND

    Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
    love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
    do than to confess she does: that is one of the
    points in the which women still give the lie to
    their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
    that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
    is so admired?

ORLANDO

    I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
    Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.

ROSALIND

    But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

ORLANDO

    Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

ROSALIND

    Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
    as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
    the reason why they are not so punished and cured
    is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
    are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

ORLANDO

    Did you ever cure any so?

ROSALIND

    Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
    his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
    woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
    youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
    and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
    inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
    passion something and for no passion truly any
    thing, as boys and women are for the most part
    cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
    him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
    for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
    from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
    madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
    the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
    And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
    me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
    heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.

ORLANDO

    I would not be cured, youth.

ROSALIND

    I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
    and come every day to my cote and woo me.

ORLANDO

    Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
    where it is.

ROSALIND

    Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
    you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
    Will you go?

ORLANDO

    With all my heart, good youth.

ROSALIND

    Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The forest.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind 

TOUCHSTONE

    Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
    goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
    doth my simple feature content you?

AUDREY

    Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!

TOUCHSTONE

    I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.

JAQUES

    [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
    in a thatched house!

TOUCHSTONE

    When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
    man's good wit seconded with the forward child
    Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
    great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
    the gods had made thee poetical.

AUDREY

    I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
    deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE

    No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
    feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
    they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.

AUDREY

    Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE

    I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
    honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
    hope thou didst feign.

AUDREY

    Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE

    No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
    honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

JAQUES

    [Aside] A material fool!

AUDREY

    Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
    make me honest.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
    were to put good meat into an unclean dish.

AUDREY

    I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.

TOUCHSTONE

    Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
    sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
    be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
    with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
    village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
    of the forest and to couple us.

JAQUES

    [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.

AUDREY

    Well, the gods give us joy!

TOUCHSTONE

    Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
    stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
    but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
    though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
    necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
    his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
    knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
    his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
    Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
    hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
    therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
    worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
    married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
    bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
    skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
    want. Here comes Sir Oliver.

    Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
    dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
    with you to your chapel?

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    Is there none here to give the woman?

TOUCHSTONE

    I will not take her on gift of any man.

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.

JAQUES

    [Advancing]
    Proceed, proceed I'll give her.

TOUCHSTONE

    Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
    sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
    last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
    toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.

JAQUES

    Will you be married, motley?

TOUCHSTONE

    As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
    as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.

JAQUES

    And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
    married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
    church, and have a good priest that can tell you
    what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
    together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
    prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.

TOUCHSTONE

    [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
    married of him than of another: for he is not like
    to marry me well; and not being well married, it
    will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.

JAQUES

    Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

TOUCHSTONE

    'Come, sweet Audrey:
    We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
    Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
    O sweet Oliver,
    O brave Oliver,
    Leave me not behind thee: but,--
    Wind away,
    Begone, I say,
    I will not to wedding with thee.

    Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
    all shall flout me out of my calling.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The forest.

    Enter ROSALIND and CELIA 

ROSALIND

    Never talk to me; I will weep.

CELIA

    Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
    that tears do not become a man.

ROSALIND

    But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA

    As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.

ROSALIND

    His very hair is of the dissembling colour.

CELIA

    Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
    Judas's own children.

ROSALIND

    I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.

CELIA

    An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.

ROSALIND

    And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
    of holy bread.

CELIA

    He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
    of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
    the very ice of chastity is in them.

ROSALIND

    But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
    comes not?

CELIA

    Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

ROSALIND

    Do you think so?

CELIA

    Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
    horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
    think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
    worm-eaten nut.

ROSALIND

    Not true in love?

CELIA

    Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.

ROSALIND

    You have heard him swear downright he was.

CELIA

    'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
    no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
    both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
    here in the forest on the duke your father.

ROSALIND

    I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
    him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
    him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
    But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
    man as Orlando?

CELIA

    O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
    speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
    them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
    his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
    but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
    goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
    guides. Who comes here?

    Enter CORIN

CORIN

    Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
    After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
    Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
    Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
    That was his mistress.

CELIA

    Well, and what of him?

CORIN

    If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
    Between the pale complexion of true love
    And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
    Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
    If you will mark it.

ROSALIND

    O, come, let us remove:
    The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
    Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
    I'll prove a busy actor in their play.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the forest.

    Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE 

SILVIUS

    Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
    Say that you love me not, but say not so
    In bitterness. The common executioner,
    Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
    But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

    Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind

PHEBE

    I would not be thy executioner:
    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
    Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
    'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
    Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
    Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
    Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
    Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
    Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
    Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
    Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
    Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
    Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
    The cicatrice and capable impressure
    Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
    Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
    Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
    That can do hurt.

SILVIUS

    O dear Phebe,
    If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
    You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
    Then shall you know the wounds invisible
    That love's keen arrows make.

PHEBE

    But till that time
    Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
    As till that time I shall not pity thee.

ROSALIND

    And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
    That you insult, exult, and all at once,
    Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
    As, by my faith, I see no more in you
    Than without candle may go dark to bed--
    Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
    I see no more in you than in the ordinary
    Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
    I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
    No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
    'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
    Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
    That can entame my spirits to your worship.
    You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
    Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
    You are a thousand times a properer man
    Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
    That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
    'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
    And out of you she sees herself more proper
    Than any of her lineaments can show her.
    But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
    For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
    Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
    Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
    Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
    So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.

PHEBE

    Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
    I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

ROSALIND

    He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
    fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
    she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
    with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE

    For no ill will I bear you.

ROSALIND

    I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
    For I am falser than vows made in wine:
    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
    Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
    And be not proud: though all the world could see,
    None could be so abused in sight as he.
    Come, to our flock.

    Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE

    Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
    'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'

SILVIUS

    Sweet Phebe,--

PHEBE

    Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS

    Sweet Phebe, pity me.

PHEBE

    Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

SILVIUS

    Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
    If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
    By giving love your sorrow and my grief
    Were both extermined.

PHEBE

    Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS

    I would have you.

PHEBE

    Why, that were covetousness.
    Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
    But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
    I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
    But do not look for further recompense
    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

SILVIUS

    So holy and so perfect is my love,
    And I in such a poverty of grace,
    That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
    To glean the broken ears after the man
    That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
    A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.

PHEBE

    Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS

    Not very well, but I have met him oft;
    And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
    That the old carlot once was master of.

PHEBE

    Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
    But what care I for words? yet words do well
    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
    It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
    But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
    He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
    Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
    He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
    His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
    There was a pretty redness in his lip,
    A little riper and more lusty red
    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
    Between the constant red and mingled damask.
    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
    In parcels as I did, would have gone near
    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
    I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
    I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
    For what had he to do to chide at me?
    He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
    And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
    I marvel why I answer'd not again:
    But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
    And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS

    Phebe, with all my heart.

PHEBE

    I'll write it straight;
    The matter's in my head and in my heart:
    I will be bitter with him and passing short.
    Go with me, Silvius.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. The forest.

    Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES 

JAQUES

    I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
    with thee.

ROSALIND

    They say you are a melancholy fellow.

JAQUES

    I am so; I do love it better than laughing.

ROSALIND

    Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
    fellows and betray themselves to every modern
    censure worse than drunkards.

JAQUES

    Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.

ROSALIND

    Why then, 'tis good to be a post.

JAQUES

    I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
    emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
    nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
    soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
    which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
    the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
    extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
    contemplation of my travels, in which my often
    rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.

ROSALIND

    A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
    be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
    other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
    nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.

JAQUES

    Yes, I have gained my experience.

ROSALIND

    And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
    a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
    sad; and to travel for it too!

    Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO

    Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!

JAQUES

    Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.

    Exit

ROSALIND

    Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
    wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
    own country, be out of love with your nativity and
    almost chide God for making you that countenance you
    are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
    gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
    all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
    another trick, never come in my sight more.

ORLANDO

    My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.

ROSALIND

    Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
    divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
    a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
    affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
    hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
    him heart-whole.

ORLANDO

    Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
    had as lief be wooed of a snail.

ORLANDO

    Of a snail?

ROSALIND

    Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
    carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
    I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
    his destiny with him.

ORLANDO

    What's that?

ROSALIND

    Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
    beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
    his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.

ORLANDO

    Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.

ROSALIND

    And I am your Rosalind.

CELIA

    It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
    Rosalind of a better leer than you.

ROSALIND

    Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
    humour and like enough to consent. What would you
    say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I would kiss before I spoke.

ROSALIND

    Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
    gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
    occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
    out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
    warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

ORLANDO

    How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND

    Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.

ORLANDO

    Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND

    Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
    I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.

ORLANDO

    What, of my suit?

ROSALIND

    Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
    Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
    talking of her.

ROSALIND

    Well in her person I say I will not have you.

ORLANDO

    Then in mine own person I die.

ROSALIND

    No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
    almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
    there was not any man died in his own person,
    videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
    dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
    of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
    year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
    for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
    but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
    taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
    coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
    But these are all lies: men have died from time to
    time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.

ORLANDO

    I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
    for, I protest, her frown might kill me.

ROSALIND

    By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
    I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
    disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
    it.

ORLANDO

    Then love me, Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.

ORLANDO

    And wilt thou have me?

ROSALIND

    Ay, and twenty such.

ORLANDO

    What sayest thou?

ROSALIND

    Are you not good?

ORLANDO

    I hope so.

ROSALIND

    Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
    Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
    Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?

ORLANDO

    Pray thee, marry us.

CELIA

    I cannot say the words.

ROSALIND

    You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'

CELIA

    Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I will.

ROSALIND

    Ay, but when?

ORLANDO

    Why now; as fast as she can marry us.

ROSALIND

    Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'

ORLANDO

    I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

ROSALIND

    I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
    thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
    before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
    runs before her actions.

ORLANDO

    So do all thoughts; they are winged.

ROSALIND

    Now tell me how long you would have her after you
    have possessed her.

ORLANDO

    For ever and a day.

ROSALIND

    Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
    men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
    maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
    changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
    of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
    new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
    than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
    in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
    disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
    that when thou art inclined to sleep.

ORLANDO

    But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND

    By my life, she will do as I do.

ORLANDO

    O, but she is wise.

ROSALIND

    Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
    wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
    wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
    'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
    with the smoke out at the chimney.

ORLANDO

    A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
    'Wit, whither wilt?'

ROSALIND

    Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
    your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.

ORLANDO

    And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

ROSALIND

    Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
    never take her without her answer, unless you take
    her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
    make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
    never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
    it like a fool!

ORLANDO

    For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.

ROSALIND

    Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.

ORLANDO

    I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
    will be with thee again.

ROSALIND

    Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
    would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
    thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
    won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
    death! Two o'clock is your hour?

ORLANDO

    Ay, sweet Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
    me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
    if you break one jot of your promise or come one
    minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
    pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
    and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
    may be chosen out of the gross band of the
    unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
    your promise.

ORLANDO

    With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
    Rosalind: so adieu.

ROSALIND

    Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try: adieu.

    Exit ORLANDO

CELIA

    You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
    we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
    head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
    her own nest.

ROSALIND

    O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
    didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
    it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
    bottom, like the bay of Portugal.

CELIA

    Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
    affection in, it runs out.

ROSALIND

    No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
    of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
    that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
    because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
    am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
    of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
    sigh till he come.

CELIA

    And I'll sleep.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The forest.

    Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters 

JAQUES

    Which is he that killed the deer?

A Lord

    Sir, it was I.

JAQUES

    Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
    conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
    horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
    you no song, forester, for this purpose?

Forester

    Yes, sir.

JAQUES

    Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
    make noise enough.
    SONG.

Forester

    What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
    His leather skin and horns to wear.
    Then sing him home;

    The rest shall bear this burden
    Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
    It was a crest ere thou wast born:
    Thy father's father wore it,
    And thy father bore it:
    The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
    Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The forest.

    Enter ROSALIND and CELIA 

ROSALIND

    How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
    here much Orlando!

CELIA

    I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
    hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
    sleep. Look, who comes here.

    Enter SILVIUS

SILVIUS

    My errand is to you, fair youth;
    My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
    I know not the contents; but, as I guess
    By the stern brow and waspish action
    Which she did use as she was writing of it,
    It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
    I am but as a guiltless messenger.

ROSALIND

    Patience herself would startle at this letter
    And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
    She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
    She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
    Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
    Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
    This is a letter of your own device.

SILVIUS

    No, I protest, I know not the contents:
    Phebe did write it.

ROSALIND

    Come, come, you are a fool
    And turn'd into the extremity of love.
    I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
    A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
    That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
    She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
    I say she never did invent this letter;
    This is a man's invention and his hand.

SILVIUS

    Sure, it is hers.

ROSALIND

    Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
    A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
    Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
    Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
    Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
    Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

SILVIUS

    So please you, for I never heard it yet;
    Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

ROSALIND

    She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

    Reads
    Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
    That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
    Can a woman rail thus?

SILVIUS

    Call you this railing?

ROSALIND

    [Reads]
    Why, thy godhead laid apart,
    Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
    Did you ever hear such railing?
    Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
    That could do no vengeance to me.
    Meaning me a beast.
    If the scorn of your bright eyne
    Have power to raise such love in mine,
    Alack, in me what strange effect
    Would they work in mild aspect!
    Whiles you chid me, I did love;
    How then might your prayers move!
    He that brings this love to thee
    Little knows this love in me:
    And by him seal up thy mind;
    Whether that thy youth and kind
    Will the faithful offer take
    Of me and all that I can make;
    Or else by him my love deny,
    And then I'll study how to die.

SILVIUS

    Call you this chiding?

CELIA

    Alas, poor shepherd!

ROSALIND

    Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
    thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
    instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
    be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
    love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
    her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
    thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
    thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
    hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

    Exit SILVIUS

    Enter OLIVER

OLIVER

    Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
    A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?

CELIA

    West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
    But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
    There's none within.

OLIVER

    If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
    Then should I know you by description;
    Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
    Of female favour, and bestows himself
    Like a ripe sister: the woman low
    And browner than her brother.' Are not you
    The owner of the house I did inquire for?

CELIA

    It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

OLIVER

    Orlando doth commend him to you both,
    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
    He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

ROSALIND

    I am: what must we understand by this?

OLIVER

    Some of my shame; if you will know of me
    What man I am, and how, and why, and where
    This handkercher was stain'd.

CELIA

    I pray you, tell it.

OLIVER

    When last the young Orlando parted from you
    He left a promise to return again
    Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
    Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
    And mark what object did present itself:
    Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
    And high top bald with dry antiquity,
    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
    Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
    A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
    And with indented glides did slip away
    Into a bush: under which bush's shade
    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
    The royal disposition of that beast
    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
    This seen, Orlando did approach the man
    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

CELIA

    O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
    And he did render him the most unnatural
    That lived amongst men.

OLIVER

    And well he might so do,
    For well I know he was unnatural.

ROSALIND

    But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

OLIVER

    Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    Made him give battle to the lioness,
    Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
    From miserable slumber I awaked.

CELIA

    Are you his brother?

ROSALIND

    Wast you he rescued?

CELIA

    Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

OLIVER

    'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame
    To tell you what I was, since my conversion
    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

ROSALIND

    But, for the bloody napkin?

OLIVER

    By and by.
    When from the first to last betwixt us two
    Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
    As how I came into that desert place:--
    In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
    Committing me unto my brother's love;
    Who led me instantly unto his cave,
    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
    The lioness had torn some flesh away,
    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
    Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
    To tell this story, that you might excuse
    His broken promise, and to give this napkin
    Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

    ROSALIND swoons

CELIA

    Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

OLIVER

    Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

CELIA

    There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

OLIVER

    Look, he recovers.

ROSALIND

    I would I were at home.

CELIA

    We'll lead you thither.
    I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

OLIVER

    Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
    man's heart.

ROSALIND

    I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
    think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
    your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!

OLIVER

    This was not counterfeit: there is too great
    testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
    of earnest.

ROSALIND

    Counterfeit, I assure you.

OLIVER

    Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

ROSALIND

    So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.

CELIA

    Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
    homewards. Good sir, go with us.

OLIVER

    That will I, for I must bear answer back
    How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend
    my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The forest.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY 

TOUCHSTONE

    We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.

AUDREY

    Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
    gentleman's saying.

TOUCHSTONE

    A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile
    Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the
    forest lays claim to you.

AUDREY

    Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in
    the world: here comes the man you mean.

TOUCHSTONE

    It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my
    troth, we that have good wits have much to answer
    for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.

    Enter WILLIAM

WILLIAM

    Good even, Audrey.

AUDREY

    God ye good even, William.

WILLIAM

    And good even to you, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
    head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?

WILLIAM

    Five and twenty, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    A ripe age. Is thy name William?

WILLIAM

    William, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?

WILLIAM

    Ay, sir, I thank God.

TOUCHSTONE

    'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?

WILLIAM

    Faith, sir, so so.

TOUCHSTONE

    'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
    yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?

WILLIAM

    Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

TOUCHSTONE

    Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
    'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
    knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
    philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
    would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
    meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
    lips to open. You do love this maid?

WILLIAM

    I do, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    Give me your hand. Art thou learned?

WILLIAM

    No, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it
    is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
    of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
    the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse
    is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.

WILLIAM

    Which he, sir?

TOUCHSTONE

    He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
    clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
    society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
    female,--which in the common is woman; which
    together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better
    understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make
    thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
    liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
    thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy
    with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with
    policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:
    therefore tremble and depart.

AUDREY

    Do, good William.

WILLIAM

    God rest you merry, sir.

    Exit

CORIN

SCENE II. The forest.

    Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER 

ORLANDO

    Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
    should like her? that but seeing you should love
    her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
    grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?

OLIVER

    Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
    poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
    wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,
    I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
    consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
    shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
    the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
    estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.

ORLANDO

    You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
    thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
    followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
    you, here comes my Rosalind.

    Enter ROSALIND

ROSALIND

    God save you, brother.

OLIVER

    And you, fair sister.

    Exit

ROSALIND

    O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
    wear thy heart in a scarf!

ORLANDO

    It is my arm.

ROSALIND

    I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
    of a lion.

ORLANDO

    Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

ROSALIND

    Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
    swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?

ORLANDO

    Ay, and greater wonders than that.

ROSALIND

    O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
    never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
    and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
    overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
    met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
    loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
    sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
    sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
    and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
    to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
    else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
    the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
    cannot part them.

ORLANDO

    They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
    duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
    is to look into happiness through another man's
    eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
    the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
    think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.

ROSALIND

    Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I can live no longer by thinking.

ROSALIND

    I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
    Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
    that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
    speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
    of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
    neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
    some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
    yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
    you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
    since I was three year old, conversed with a
    magician, most profound in his art and yet not
    damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
    as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
    marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
    what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
    not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
    to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
    as she is and without any danger.

ORLANDO

    Speakest thou in sober meanings?

ROSALIND

    By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
    say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
    best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
    married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.

    Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
    Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.

PHEBE

    Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
    To show the letter that I writ to you.

ROSALIND

    I care not if I have: it is my study
    To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
    You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
    Look upon him, love him; he worships you.

PHEBE

    Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

SILVIUS

    It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
    And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE

    And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO

    And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    And I for no woman.

SILVIUS

    It is to be all made of faith and service;
    And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE

    And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO

    And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    And I for no woman.

SILVIUS

    It is to be all made of fantasy,
    All made of passion and all made of wishes,
    All adoration, duty, and observance,
    All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
    All purity, all trial, all observance;
    And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE

    And so am I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO

    And so am I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    And so am I for no woman.

PHEBE

    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

SILVIUS

    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ORLANDO

    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ROSALIND

    Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'

ORLANDO

    To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.

ROSALIND

    Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
    of Irish wolves against the moon.

    To SILVIUS
    I will help you, if I can:

    To PHEBE
    I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.

    To PHEBE
    I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
    married to-morrow:

    To ORLANDO
    I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
    shall be married to-morrow:

    To SILVIUS
    I will content you, if what pleases you contents
    you, and you shall be married to-morrow.

    To ORLANDO
    As you love Rosalind, meet:

    To SILVIUS
    as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
    I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.

SILVIUS

    I'll not fail, if I live.

PHEBE

    Nor I.

ORLANDO

    Nor I.

TOUCHSTONE

    To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will
    we be married.

AUDREY

    I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
    no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
    world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.

    Enter two Pages

First Page

    Well met, honest gentleman.

TOUCHSTONE

    By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.

Second Page

    We are for you: sit i' the middle.

First Page

    Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
    spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
    prologues to a bad voice?

Second Page

    I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
    gipsies on a horse.
    SONG.
    It was a lover and his lass,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    That o'er the green corn-field did pass
    In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
    When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
    Sweet lovers love the spring.
    Between the acres of the rye,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
    These pretty country folks would lie,
    In spring time, & c.
    This carol they began that hour,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    How that a life was but a flower
    In spring time, & c.
    And therefore take the present time,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
    For love is crowned with the prime
    In spring time, & c.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
    matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
    untuneable.

First Page

    You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.

TOUCHSTONE

    By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear
    such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
    your voices! Come, Audrey.

SCENE IV. The forest.

    Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA 

DUKE SENIOR

    Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
    Can do all this that he hath promised?

ORLANDO

    I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
    As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

    Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE

ROSALIND

    Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
    You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
    You will bestow her on Orlando here?

DUKE SENIOR

    That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

ROSALIND

    And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?

ORLANDO

    That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

ROSALIND

    You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?

PHEBE

    That will I, should I die the hour after.

ROSALIND

    But if you do refuse to marry me,
    You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

PHEBE

    So is the bargain.

ROSALIND

    You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?

SILVIUS

    Though to have her and death were both one thing.

ROSALIND

    I have promised to make all this matter even.
    Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
    You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
    Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
    Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
    Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
    If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
    To make these doubts all even.

    Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR

    I do remember in this shepherd boy
    Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

ORLANDO

    My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
    Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
    But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
    Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
    Whom he reports to be a great magician,
    Obscured in the circle of this forest.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

JAQUES

    There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
    couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
    very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.

TOUCHSTONE

    Salutation and greeting to you all!

JAQUES

    Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
    motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
    the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.

TOUCHSTONE

    If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
    purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
    a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
    with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
    had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

JAQUES

    And how was that ta'en up?

TOUCHSTONE

    Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
    seventh cause.

JAQUES

    How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

DUKE SENIOR

    I like him very well.

TOUCHSTONE

    God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
    press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
    copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
    marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
    sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
    humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
    will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
    poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.

DUKE SENIOR

    By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

TOUCHSTONE

    According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.

JAQUES

    But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
    quarrel on the seventh cause?

TOUCHSTONE

    Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
    seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
    cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
    if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
    mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
    If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
    would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
    this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
    not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
    called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
    well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
    is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
    well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
    Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

JAQUES

    And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE

    I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
    nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
    measured swords and parted.

JAQUES

    Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE

    O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
    books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
    The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
    Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
    fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
    Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
    Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
    these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
    avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
    justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
    parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
    of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
    they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
    only peacemaker; much virtue in If.

JAQUES

    Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
    any thing and yet a fool.

DUKE SENIOR

    He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
    the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

HYMEN

    Then is there mirth in heaven,
    When earthly things made even
    Atone together.
    Good duke, receive thy daughter
    Hymen from heaven brought her,
    Yea, brought her hither,
    That thou mightst join her hand with his
    Whose heart within his bosom is.

ROSALIND

    [To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.

    To ORLANDO
    To you I give myself, for I am yours.

DUKE SENIOR

    If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

ORLANDO

    If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

PHEBE

    If sight and shape be true,
    Why then, my love adieu!

ROSALIND

    I'll have no father, if you be not he:
    I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
    Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

HYMEN

    Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
    'Tis I must make conclusion
    Of these most strange events:
    Here's eight that must take hands
    To join in Hymen's bands,
    If truth holds true contents.
    You and you no cross shall part:
    You and you are heart in heart
    You to his love must accord,
    Or have a woman to your lord:
    You and you are sure together,
    As the winter to foul weather.
    Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
    Feed yourselves with questioning;
    That reason wonder may diminish,
    How thus we met, and these things finish.
    SONG.
    Wedding is great Juno's crown:
    O blessed bond of board and bed!
    'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
    High wedlock then be honoured:
    Honour, high honour and renown,
    To Hymen, god of every town!

DUKE SENIOR

    O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
    Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

PHEBE

    I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
    Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

    Enter JAQUES DE BOYS

JAQUES DE BOYS

    Let me have audience for a word or two:
    I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
    That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
    Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
    Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
    Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
    In his own conduct, purposely to take
    His brother here and put him to the sword:
    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
    Where meeting with an old religious man,
    After some question with him, was converted
    Both from his enterprise and from the world,
    His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
    And all their lands restored to them again
    That were with him exiled. This to be true,
    I do engage my life.

DUKE SENIOR

    Welcome, young man;
    Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
    To one his lands withheld, and to the other
    A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
    First, in this forest, let us do those ends
    That here were well begun and well begot:
    And after, every of this happy number
    That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
    Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
    According to the measure of their states.
    Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
    And fall into our rustic revelry.
    Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
    With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.

JAQUES

    Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
    The duke hath put on a religious life
    And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS

    He hath.

JAQUES

    To him will I : out of these convertites
    There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

    To DUKE SENIOR
    You to your former honour I bequeath;
    Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:

    To ORLANDO
    You to a love that your true faith doth merit:

    To OLIVER
    You to your land and love and great allies:

    To SILVIUS
    You to a long and well-deserved bed:

    To TOUCHSTONE
    And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
    Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
    I am for other than for dancing measures.

DUKE SENIOR

    Stay, Jaques, stay.

JAQUES

    To see no pastime I what you would have
    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.

DUKE SENIOR

    Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

    A dance
    EPILOGUE

ROSALIND

    It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
    but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
    the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
    no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
    epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
    and good plays prove the better by the help of good
    epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
    neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
    you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
    furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
    become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
    with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
    you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
    please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
    you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
    none of you hates them--that between you and the
    women the play may please. If I were a woman I
    would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
    me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
    defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
    beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
    kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.

AEGEON

    Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
    And by the doom of death end woes and all.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
    I am not partial to infringe our laws:
    The enmity and discord which of late
    Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
    To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
    Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
    Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
    Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
    For, since the mortal and intestine jars
    'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
    It hath in solemn synods been decreed
    Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
    To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
    If any born at Ephesus be seen
    At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
    Again: if any Syracusian born
    Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
    His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
    Unless a thousand marks be levied,
    To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
    Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
    Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
    Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.

AEGEON

    Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
    My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
    Why thou departed'st from thy native home
    And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.

AEGEON

    A heavier task could not have been imposed
    Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
    Yet, that the world may witness that my end
    Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
    I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
    In Syracusa was I born, and wed
    Unto a woman, happy but for me,
    And by me, had not our hap been bad.
    With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
    By prosperous voyages I often made
    To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
    And the great care of goods at random left
    Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
    From whom my absence was not six months old
    Before herself, almost at fainting under
    The pleasing punishment that women bear,
    Had made provision for her following me
    And soon and safe arrived where I was.
    There had she not been long, but she became
    A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
    And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
    As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
    That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
    A meaner woman was delivered
    Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
    Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
    I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
    My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
    Made daily motions for our home return:
    Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
    We came aboard.
    A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
    Before the always wind-obeying deep
    Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
    But longer did we not retain much hope;
    For what obscured light the heavens did grant
    Did but convey unto our fearful minds
    A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
    Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
    Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
    Weeping before for what she saw must come,
    And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
    That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
    Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
    And this it was, for other means was none:
    The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
    And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
    My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
    Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
    Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
    To him one of the other twins was bound,
    Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
    The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
    Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
    Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
    And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
    Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
    At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
    Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
    And by the benefit of his wished light,
    The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
    Two ships from far making amain to us,
    Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
    But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
    Gather the sequel by that went before.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
    For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

AEGEON

    O, had the gods done so, I had not now
    Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
    For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
    We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
    Which being violently borne upon,
    Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
    So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
    Fortune had left to both of us alike
    What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
    Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
    With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
    Was carried with more speed before the wind;
    And in our sight they three were taken up
    By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
    At length, another ship had seized on us;
    And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
    Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
    And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
    Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
    And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
    Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
    That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
    To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

DUKE SOLINUS

    And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
    Do me the favour to dilate at full
    What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

AEGEON

    My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
    At eighteen years became inquisitive
    After his brother: and importuned me
    That his attendant--so his case was like,
    Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
    Might bear him company in the quest of him:
    Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
    I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
    Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
    Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
    And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
    Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
    Or that or any place that harbours men.
    But here must end the story of my life;
    And happy were I in my timely death,
    Could all my travels warrant me they live.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
    To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
    Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
    Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
    Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
    My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
    But, though thou art adjudged to the death
    And passed sentence may not be recall'd
    But to our honour's great disparagement,
    Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
    Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
    To seek thy life by beneficial help:
    Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
    Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
    And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
    Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

Gaoler

    I will, my lord.

AEGEON

    Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
    But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    He that commends me to mine own content
    Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
    I to the world am like a drop of water
    That in the ocean seeks another drop,
    Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
    Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
    So I, to find a mother and a brother,
    In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
    Here comes the almanac of my true date.
    What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
    The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
    The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
    My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
    She is so hot because the meat is cold;
    The meat is cold because you come not home;
    You come not home because you have no stomach;
    You have no stomach having broke your fast;
    But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
    Are penitent for your default to-day.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
    Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
    To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
    The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I am not in a sportive humour now:
    Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
    We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
    So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
    I from my mistress come to you in post;
    If I return, I shall be post indeed,
    For she will score your fault upon my pate.
    Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
    And strike you home without a messenger.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
    Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
    Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
    And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
    Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
    My mistress and her sister stays for you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
    Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
    That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
    Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
    Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
    But not a thousand marks between you both.
    If I should pay your worship those again,
    Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
    She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
    And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
    Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
    Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Upon my life, by some device or other
    The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
    They say this town is full of cozenage,
    As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
    Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
    Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
    Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
    And many such-like liberties of sin:
    If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
    I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
    I greatly fear my money is not safe.

    Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

    Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA 

ADRIANA

    Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
    That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
    Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

LUCIANA

    Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
    And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
    Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
    A man is master of his liberty:
    Time is their master, and, when they see time,
    They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

ADRIANA

    Why should their liberty than ours be more?

LUCIANA

    Because their business still lies out o' door.

ADRIANA

    Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

LUCIANA

    O, know he is the bridle of your will.

ADRIANA

    There's none but asses will be bridled so.

LUCIANA

    Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
    There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
    But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
    The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
    Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
    Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
    Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
    Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
    Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
    Are masters to their females, and their lords:
    Then let your will attend on their accords.

ADRIANA

    This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

LUCIANA

    Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

ADRIANA

    But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA

    Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

ADRIANA

    How if your husband start some other where?

LUCIANA

    Till he come home again, I would forbear.

ADRIANA

    Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
    They can be meek that have no other cause.
    A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
    We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
    But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
    As much or more would we ourselves complain:
    So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
    With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
    But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
    This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

LUCIANA

    Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
    Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

ADRIANA

    Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
    can witness.

ADRIANA

    Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
    Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA

    Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
    blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
    understand them.

ADRIANA

    But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
    hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA

    Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I mean not cuckold-mad;
    But, sure, he is stark mad.
    When I desired him to come home to dinner,
    He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
    ''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
    'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
    'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
    'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
    'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
    'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
    I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

LUCIANA

    Quoth who?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Quoth my master:
    'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
    So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
    I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
    For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA

    Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Go back again, and be new beaten home?
    For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA

    Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    And he will bless that cross with other beating:
    Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA

    Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Am I so round with you as you with me,
    That like a football you do spurn me thus?
    You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
    If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

    Exit

LUCIANA

    Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

ADRIANA

    His company must do his minions grace,
    Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
    Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
    From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
    Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
    If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
    Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
    Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
    That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
    What ruins are in me that can be found,
    By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
    Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
    A sunny look of his would soon repair
    But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
    And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA

    Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

ADRIANA

    Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
    I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
    Or else what lets it but he would be here?
    Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
    Would that alone, alone he would detain,
    So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
    I see the jewel best enamelled
    Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
    That others touch, and often touching will
    Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
    By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
    Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
    I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

LUCIANA

    How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
    Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
    Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
    By computation and mine host's report.
    I could not speak with Dromio since at first
    I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
    How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
    As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
    You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
    Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
    My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
    That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I did not see you since you sent me hence,
    Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
    And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
    For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
    What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
    Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

    Beating him

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
    Upon what bargain do you give it me?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Because that I familiarly sometimes
    Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
    Your sauciness will jest upon my love
    And make a common of my serious hours.
    When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
    But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
    If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
    And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
    Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
    had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
    long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
    it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
    But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
    a wherefore.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
    For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
    When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
    nor reason?
    Well, sir, I thank you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thank me, sir, for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
    something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    In good time, sir; what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Basting.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
    dry basting.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
    time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
    pate of father Time himself.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
    grows bald by nature.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
    lost hair of another man.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
    so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
    and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
    it in a kind of jollity.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    For two; and sound ones too.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, not sound, I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Sure ones, then.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Certain ones then.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Name them.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    The one, to save the money that he spends in
    trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
    drop in his porridge.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    You would all this time have proved there is no
    time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
    lost by nature.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
    time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
    to the world's end will have bald followers.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
    But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

    Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA

    Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
    Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
    I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
    The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
    That never words were music to thine ear,
    That never object pleasing in thine eye,
    That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
    That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
    Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
    How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
    That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
    Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
    That, undividable, incorporate,
    Am better than thy dear self's better part.
    Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
    For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
    A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
    And take unmingled that same drop again,
    Without addition or diminishing,
    As take from me thyself and not me too.
    How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
    Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
    And that this body, consecrate to thee,
    By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
    Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
    And hurl the name of husband in my face
    And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
    And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
    And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
    I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
    I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
    My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
    For if we too be one and thou play false,
    I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
    Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
    Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
    I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
    In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
    As strange unto your town as to your talk;
    Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
    Want wit in all one word to understand.

LUCIANA

    Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
    When were you wont to use my sister thus?
    She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    By Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    By me?

ADRIANA

    By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
    That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
    Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
    What is the course and drift of your compact?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
    Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I never spake with her in all my life.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    How can she thus then call us by our names,
    Unless it be by inspiration.

ADRIANA

    How ill agrees it with your gravity
    To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
    Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
    Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
    But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
    Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
    Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
    Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
    Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
    If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
    Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
    Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
    Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
    What, was I married to her in my dream?
    Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
    What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
    Until I know this sure uncertainty,
    I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

LUCIANA

    Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
    This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
    We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
    If we obey them not, this will ensue,
    They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

LUCIANA

    Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
    Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I am transformed, master, am I not?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thou hast thine own form.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, I am an ape.

LUCIANA

    If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
    'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
    But I should know her as well as she knows me.

ADRIANA

    Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
    To put the finger in the eye and weep,
    Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
    Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
    Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
    And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
    Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
    Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
    Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
    Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
    Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
    I'll say as they say and persever so,
    And in this mist at all adventures go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

ADRIANA

    Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

LUCIANA

    Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR 

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
    My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
    Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
    To see the making of her carcanet,
    And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
    But here's a villain that would face me down
    He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
    And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
    And that I did deny my wife and house.
    Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
    That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
    If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
    Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I think thou art an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Marry, so it doth appear
    By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
    I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
    You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
    May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

BALTHAZAR

    I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
    welcome dear.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
    A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

BALTHAZAR

    Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

BALTHAZAR

    Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
    But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
    Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
    But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
    idiot, patch!
    Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
    Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
    for such store,
    When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
    the street.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
    catch cold on's feet.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
    me wherefore.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
    when you may.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name
    is Dromio.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
    The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
    If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
    Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
    name for an ass.

LUCE

    [Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
    at the gate?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Let my master in, Luce.

LUCE

    [Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;
    And so tell your master.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    O Lord, I must laugh!
    Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?

LUCE

    [Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?
    can you tell?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
    answered him well.

ANTIPHOLUS

    Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
    OF EPHESUS

LUCE

    [Within] I thought to have asked you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] And you said no.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou baggage, let me in.

LUCE

    [Within] Can you tell for whose sake?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Master, knock the door hard.

LUCE

    [Within] Let him knock till it ache.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

LUCE

    [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

ADRIANA

    [Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all
    this noise?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with
    unruly boys.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

ADRIANA

    [Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

ANGELO

    Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
    fain have either.

BALTHAZAR

    In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
    Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
    It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
    knave's pate.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
    Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
    thee, hind!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
    let me in.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
    For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
    If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

BALTHAZAR

    Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
    Herein you war against your reputation
    And draw within the compass of suspect
    The unviolated honour of your wife.
    Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
    Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
    Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
    And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
    Why at this time the doors are made against you.
    Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
    And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
    And about evening come yourself alone
    To know the reason of this strange restraint.
    If by strong hand you offer to break in
    Now in the stirring passage of the day,
    A vulgar comment will be made of it,
    And that supposed by the common rout
    Against your yet ungalled estimation
    That may with foul intrusion enter in
    And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
    For slander lives upon succession,
    For ever housed where it gets possession.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
    And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
    I know a wench of excellent discourse,
    Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
    There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
    My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
    Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
    To her will we to dinner.

    To Angelo
    Get you home
    And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
    Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
    For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
    Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
    Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
    Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
    I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

ANGELO

    I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 

LUCIANA

    And may it be that you have quite forgot
    A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
    Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
    Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
    If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
    Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
    Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
    Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
    Let not my sister read it in your eye;
    Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
    Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
    Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
    Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
    Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
    Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
    What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
    'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
    And let her read it in thy looks at board:
    Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
    Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
    Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
    Being compact of credit, that you love us;
    Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
    We in your motion turn and you may move us.
    Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
    Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
    'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
    When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
    Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
    Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
    Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
    Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
    Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
    Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
    The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
    Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
    To make it wander in an unknown field?
    Are you a god? would you create me new?
    Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
    But if that I am I, then well I know
    Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
    Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
    Far more, far more to you do I decline.
    O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
    To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
    Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
    Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
    And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
    And in that glorious supposition think
    He gains by death that hath such means to die:
    Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

LUCIANA

    What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

LUCIANA

    It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

LUCIANA

    Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

LUCIANA

    Why call you me love? call my sister so.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thy sister's sister.

LUCIANA

    That's my sister.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    No;
    It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
    Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
    My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
    My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

LUCIANA

    All this my sister is, or else should be.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
    Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
    Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
    Give me thy hand.

LUCIANA

    O, soft, air! hold you still:
    I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.

    Exit

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
    am I myself?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.

ANTIPHOLUS

    What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
    that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What claim lays she to thee?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
    horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
    being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
    being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What is she?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
    not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
    but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
    wondrous fat marriage.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
    and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
    lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
    warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
    Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
    she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What complexion is she of?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
    clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
    shoes in the grime of it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    That's a fault that water will mend.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What's her name?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
    an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
    hip to hip.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Then she bears some breadth?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
    she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
    countries in her.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    In what part of her body stands Ireland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where Scotland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where France?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
    against her heir.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where England?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
    whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
    by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where Spain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where America, the Indies?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
    rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
    aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
    armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
    drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
    Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
    privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
    shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
    left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
    And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
    faith and my heart of steel,
    She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
    me turn i' the wheel.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
    An if the wind blow any way from shore,
    I will not harbour in this town to-night:
    If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
    Where I will walk till thou return to me.
    If every one knows us and we know none,
    'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    As from a bear a man would run for life,
    So fly I from her that would be my wife.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    There's none but witches do inhabit here;
    And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
    She that doth call me husband, even my soul
    Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
    Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
    Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
    Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
    But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
    I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

    Enter ANGELO with the chain

ANGELO

    Master Antipholus,--
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Ay, that's my name.

ANGELO

    I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
    I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
    The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What is your will that I shall do with this?

ANGELO

    What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

ANGELO

    Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
    Go home with it and please your wife withal;
    And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
    And then receive my money for the chain.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
    For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

ANGELO

    You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
    But this I think, there's no man is so vain
    That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
    I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
    When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
    I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
    If any ship put out, then straight away.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. A public place.

    Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer 

Second Merchant

    You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
    And since I have not much importuned you;
    Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
    To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
    Therefore make present satisfaction,
    Or I'll attach you by this officer.

ANGELO

    Even just the sum that I do owe to you
    Is growing to me by Antipholus,
    And in the instant that I met with you
    He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
    I shall receive the money for the same.
    Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
    I will discharge my bond and thank you too.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's

Officer

    That labour may you save: see where he comes.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
    And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
    Among my wife and her confederates,
    For locking me out of my doors by day.
    But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
    Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
    I promised your presence and the chain;
    But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
    Belike you thought our love would last too long,
    If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.

ANGELO

    Saving your merry humour, here's the note
    How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
    The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
    Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
    Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
    I pray you, see him presently discharged,
    For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I am not furnish'd with the present money;
    Besides, I have some business in the town.
    Good signior, take the stranger to my house
    And with you take the chain and bid my wife
    Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
    Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

ANGELO

    Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

ANGELO

    Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
    Or else you may return without your money.

ANGELO

    Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
    Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
    And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
    Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
    I should have chid you for not bringing it,
    But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

Second Merchant

    The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.

ANGELO

    You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.

ANGELO

    Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
    Either send the chain or send me by some token.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
    where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.

Second Merchant

    My business cannot brook this dalliance.
    Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
    If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I answer you! what should I answer you?

ANGELO

    The money that you owe me for the chain.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I owe you none till I receive the chain.

ANGELO

    You know I gave it you half an hour since.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.

ANGELO

    You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
    Consider how it stands upon my credit.

Second Merchant

    Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

Officer

    I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.

ANGELO

    This touches me in reputation.
    Either consent to pay this sum for me
    Or I attach you by this officer.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Consent to pay thee that I never had!
    Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.

ANGELO

    Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
    I would not spare my brother in this case,
    If he should scorn me so apparently.

Officer

    I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
    But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
    As all the metal in your shop will answer.

ANGELO

    Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
    To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
    That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
    And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
    I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
    The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
    The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
    Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
    But for their owner, master, and yourself.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
    What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
    And told thee to what purpose and what end.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
    You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I will debate this matter at more leisure
    And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
    To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
    Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
    That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
    There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
    Tell her I am arrested in the street
    And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
    On, officer, to prison till it come.

    Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    To Adriana! that is where we dined,
    Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
    She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
    Thither I must, although against my will,
    For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

    Exit

SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

    Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA 

ADRIANA

    Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
    Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
    That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
    Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
    What observation madest thou in this case
    Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

LUCIANA

    First he denied you had in him no right.

ADRIANA

    He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

LUCIANA

    Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

ADRIANA

    And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

LUCIANA

    Then pleaded I for you.

ADRIANA

    And what said he?

LUCIANA

    That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

ADRIANA

    With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

LUCIANA

    With words that in an honest suit might move.
    First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

ADRIANA

    Didst speak him fair?

LUCIANA

    Have patience, I beseech.

ADRIANA

    I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
    My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
    He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
    Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
    Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
    Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

LUCIANA

    Who would be jealous then of such a one?
    No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

ADRIANA

    Ah, but I think him better than I say,
    And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
    Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
    My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.

LUCIANA

    How hast thou lost thy breath?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    By running fast.

ADRIANA

    Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
    A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
    One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
    A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
    A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
    A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
    countermands
    The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
    A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
    One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.

ADRIANA

    Why, man, what is the matter?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.

ADRIANA

    What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
    But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
    Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?

ADRIANA

    Go fetch it, sister.

    Exit Luciana
    This I wonder at,
    That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
    Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
    A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?

ADRIANA

    What, the chain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
    It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
    strikes one.

ADRIANA

    The hours come back! that did I never hear.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
    very fear.

ADRIANA

    As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
    worth, to season.
    Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
    That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
    If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
    Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

    Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse

ADRIANA

    Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
    And bring thy master home immediately.
    Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
    Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A public place.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
    As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
    And every one doth call me by my name.
    Some tender money to me; some invite me;
    Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
    Some offer me commodities to buy:
    Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
    And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
    And therewithal took measure of my body.
    Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
    And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

    Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
    you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
    that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
    skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
    behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
    forsake your liberty.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I understand thee not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
    bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
    that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
    and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
    men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
    his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
    morris-pike.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What, thou meanest an officer?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
    any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
    thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
    give you good rest!'
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
    bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
    you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
    Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
    deliver you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    The fellow is distract, and so am I;
    And here we wander in illusions:
    Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

    Enter a Courtezan

Courtezan

    Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
    I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
    Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, is this Mistress Satan?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    It is the devil.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
    she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
    comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
    much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
    written, they appear to men like angels of light:
    light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
    ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.

Courtezan

    Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
    Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
    long spoon.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
    the devil.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
    Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
    I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

Courtezan

    Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
    Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
    And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
    A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
    A nut, a cherry-stone;
    But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
    Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
    The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.

Courtezan

    I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
    I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.

    Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse

Courtezan

    Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
    Else would he never so demean himself.
    A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
    And for the same he promised me a chain:
    Both one and other he denies me now.
    The reason that I gather he is mad,
    Besides this present instance of his rage,
    Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
    Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
    Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
    On purpose shut the doors against his way.
    My way is now to hie home to his house,
    And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
    He rush'd into my house and took perforce
    My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
    For forty ducats is too much to lose.

    Exit

SCENE IV. A street.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer 

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
    I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
    To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
    My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
    And will not lightly trust the messenger
    That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
    I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end
    Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
    How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    But where's the money?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

    Beating him

Officer

    Good sir, be patient.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.

Officer

    Good, now, hold thy tongue.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
    your blows.

ANTIPHOLUS

    Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
    ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
    ears. I have served him from the hour of my
    nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
    hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
    heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
    with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
    raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
    it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
    I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
    beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
    lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.

    Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
    rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
    rope's-end.'
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Wilt thou still talk?

    Beating him

Courtezan

    How say you now? is not your husband mad?

ADRIANA

    His incivility confirms no less.
    Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
    Establish him in his true sense again,
    And I will please you what you will demand.

LUCIANA

    Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

Courtezan

    Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!

PINCH

    Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

    Striking him

PINCH

    I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
    To yield possession to my holy prayers
    And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
    I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

ADRIANA

    O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You minion, you, are these your customers?
    Did this companion with the saffron face
    Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
    Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
    And I denied to enter in my house?

ADRIANA

    O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
    Where would you had remain'd until this time,
    Free from these slanders and this open shame!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And did not she herself revile me there?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And did not I in rage depart from thence?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
    That since have felt the vigour of his rage.

ADRIANA

    Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?

PINCH

    It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
    And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

ADRIANA

    Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
    By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
    But surely master, not a rag of money.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

ADRIANA

    He came to me and I deliver'd it.

LUCIANA

    And I am witness with her that she did.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    God and the rope-maker bear me witness
    That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

PINCH

    Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
    I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
    They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
    And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

ADRIANA

    I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    And, gentle master, I received no gold;
    But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

ADRIANA

    Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
    And art confederate with a damned pack
    To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
    But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
    That would behold in me this shameful sport.

    Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives

ADRIANA

    O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

PINCH

    More company! The fiend is strong within him.

LUCIANA

    Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
    I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
    To make a rescue?

Officer

    Masters, let him go
    He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

PINCH

    Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.

    They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus

ADRIANA

    What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
    Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
    Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

Officer

    He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
    The debt he owes will be required of me.

ADRIANA

    I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
    Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
    And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
    Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
    Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    O most unhappy strumpet!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
    cry 'The devil!'

LUCIANA

    God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

ADRIANA

    Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.

    Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan
    Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

Officer

    One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?

ADRIANA

    I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

Officer

    Two hundred ducats.

ADRIANA

    Say, how grows it due?

Officer

    Due for a chain your husband had of him.

ADRIANA

    He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

Courtezan

    When as your husband all in rage to-day
    Came to my house and took away my ring--
    The ring I saw upon his finger now--
    Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

ADRIANA

    It may be so, but I did never see it.
    Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
    I long to know the truth hereof at large.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse

LUCIANA

    God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

ADRIANA

    And come with naked swords.
    Let's call more help to have them bound again.

Officer

    Away! they'll kill us.

    Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I see these witches are afraid of swords.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    She that would be your wife now ran from you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
    I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
    no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
    methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
    the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
    me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
    turn witch.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I will not stay to-night for all the town;
    Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A street before a Priory.

    Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO 

ANGELO

    I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
    But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
    Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

Second Merchant

    How is the man esteemed here in the city?

ANGELO

    Of very reverend reputation, sir,
    Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
    Second to none that lives here in the city:
    His word might bear my wealth at any time.

Second Merchant

    Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse

ANGELO

    'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
    Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
    Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
    Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
    That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
    And, not without some scandal to yourself,
    With circumstance and oaths so to deny
    This chain which now you wear so openly:
    Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
    You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
    Who, but for staying on our controversy,
    Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
    This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I think I had; I never did deny it.

Second Merchant

    Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

Second Merchant

    These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
    Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
    To walk where any honest man resort.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
    I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
    Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

Second Merchant

    I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

    They draw

    Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others

ADRIANA

    Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
    Some get within him, take his sword away:
    Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
    This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!

    Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory

    Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA

AEMELIA

    Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

ADRIANA

    To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
    Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
    And bear him home for his recovery.

ANGELO

    I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

Second Merchant

    I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

AEMELIA

    How long hath this possession held the man?

ADRIANA

    This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
    And much different from the man he was;
    But till this afternoon his passion
    Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

AEMELIA

    Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
    Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
    Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
    A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
    Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
    Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

ADRIANA

    To none of these, except it be the last;
    Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

AEMELIA

    You should for that have reprehended him.

ADRIANA

    Why, so I did.

AEMELIA

    Ay, but not rough enough.

ADRIANA

    As roughly as my modesty would let me.

AEMELIA

    Haply, in private.

ADRIANA

    And in assemblies too.

AEMELIA

    Ay, but not enough.

ADRIANA

    It was the copy of our conference:
    In bed he slept not for my urging it;
    At board he fed not for my urging it;
    Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
    In company I often glanced it;
    Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

AEMELIA

    And thereof came it that the man was mad.
    The venom clamours of a jealous woman
    Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
    It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
    And therefore comes it that his head is light.
    Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
    Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
    Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
    And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
    Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
    Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
    But moody and dull melancholy,
    Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
    And at her heels a huge infectious troop
    Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
    In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
    To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
    The consequence is then thy jealous fits
    Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

LUCIANA

    She never reprehended him but mildly,
    When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
    Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

ADRIANA

    She did betray me to my own reproof.
    Good people enter and lay hold on him.

AEMELIA

    No, not a creature enters in my house.

ADRIANA

    Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

AEMELIA

    Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
    And it shall privilege him from your hands
    Till I have brought him to his wits again,
    Or lose my labour in assaying it.

ADRIANA

    I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
    Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
    And will have no attorney but myself;
    And therefore let me have him home with me.

AEMELIA

    Be patient; for I will not let him stir
    Till I have used the approved means I have,
    With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
    To make of him a formal man again:
    It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
    A charitable duty of my order.
    Therefore depart and leave him here with me.

ADRIANA

    I will not hence and leave my husband here:
    And ill it doth beseem your holiness
    To separate the husband and the wife.

AEMELIA

    Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

    Exit

LUCIANA

    Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

ADRIANA

    Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
    And never rise until my tears and prayers
    Have won his grace to come in person hither
    And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

Second Merchant

    By this, I think, the dial points at five:
    Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
    Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
    The place of death and sorry execution,
    Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

ANGELO

    Upon what cause?

Second Merchant

    To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
    Who put unluckily into this bay
    Against the laws and statutes of this town,
    Beheaded publicly for his offence.

ANGELO

    See where they come: we will behold his death.

LUCIANA

    Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.

    Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers

DUKE SOLINUS

    Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
    If any friend will pay the sum for him,
    He shall not die; so much we tender him.

ADRIANA

    Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

DUKE SOLINUS

    She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
    It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

ADRIANA

    May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
    Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
    At your important letters,--this ill day
    A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
    That desperately he hurried through the street,
    With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
    Doing displeasure to the citizens
    By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
    Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
    Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
    Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
    That here and there his fury had committed.
    Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
    He broke from those that had the guard of him;
    And with his mad attendant and himself,
    Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
    Met us again and madly bent on us,
    Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
    We came again to bind them. Then they fled
    Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
    And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
    And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
    Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
    Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
    Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
    And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
    When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
    To do him all the grace and good I could.
    Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
    And bid the lady abbess come to me.
    I will determine this before I stir.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
    My master and his man are both broke loose,
    Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
    Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
    And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
    Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
    My master preaches patience to him and the while
    His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
    And sure, unless you send some present help,
    Between them they will kill the conjurer.

ADRIANA

    Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
    And that is false thou dost report to us.

Servant

    Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
    I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
    He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
    To scorch your face and to disfigure you.

    Cry within
    Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!

DUKE SOLINUS

    Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!

ADRIANA

    Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
    That he is borne about invisible:
    Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
    And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
    Even for the service that long since I did thee,
    When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
    Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
    That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

AEGEON

    Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
    I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
    She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
    That hath abused and dishonour'd me
    Even in the strength and height of injury!
    Beyond imagination is the wrong
    That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
    While she with harlots feasted in my house.

DUKE SOLINUS

    A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

ADRIANA

    No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
    To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
    As this is false he burdens me withal!

LUCIANA

    Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
    But she tells to your highness simple truth!

ANGELO

    O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
    In this the madman justly chargeth them.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    My liege, I am advised what I say,
    Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
    Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
    Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
    This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
    That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
    Could witness it, for he was with me then;
    Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
    Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
    Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
    Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
    I went to seek him: in the street I met him
    And in his company that gentleman.
    There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
    That I this day of him received the chain,
    Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
    He did arrest me with an officer.
    I did obey, and sent my peasant home
    For certain ducats: he with none return'd
    Then fairly I bespoke the officer
    To go in person with me to my house.
    By the way we met
    My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
    Of vile confederates. Along with them
    They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
    A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
    A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
    A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
    A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
    Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
    And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
    And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
    Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
    They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
    And in a dark and dankish vault at home
    There left me and my man, both bound together;
    Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
    I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
    Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
    To give me ample satisfaction
    For these deep shames and great indignities.

ANGELO

    My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
    That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

DUKE SOLINUS

    But had he such a chain of thee or no?

ANGELO

    He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
    These people saw the chain about his neck.

Second Merchant

    Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
    Heard you confess you had the chain of him
    After you first forswore it on the mart:
    And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
    And then you fled into this abbey here,
    From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I never came within these abbey-walls,
    Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
    I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
    And this is false you burden me withal.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
    I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
    If here you housed him, here he would have been;
    If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
    You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
    Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

Courtezan

    He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

Courtezan

    As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
    I think you are all mated or stark mad.

    Exit one to Abbess

AEGEON

    Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
    Haply I see a friend will save my life
    And pay the sum that may deliver me.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

AEGEON

    Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
    And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
    But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
    Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

AEGEON

    I am sure you both of you remember me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
    For lately we were bound, as you are now
    You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

AEGEON

    Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

ANTIPHOLUS

    I never saw you in my life till now.

AEGEON

    O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
    And careful hours with time's deformed hand
    Have written strange defeatures in my face:
    But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Neither.

AEGEON

    Dromio, nor thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    No, trust me, sir, nor I.

AEGEON

    I am sure thou dost.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
    man denies, you are now bound to believe him.

AEGEON

    Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
    Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
    In seven short years, that here my only son
    Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
    Though now this grained face of mine be hid
    In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
    And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
    Yet hath my night of life some memory,
    My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
    My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
    All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
    Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I never saw my father in my life.

AEGEON

    But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
    Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
    Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    The duke and all that know me in the city
    Can witness with me that it is not so
    I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

DUKE SOLINUS

    I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
    Have I been patron to Antipholus,
    During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
    I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

    Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse

AEMELIA

    Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

    All gather to see them

ADRIANA

    I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

DUKE SOLINUS

    One of these men is Genius to the other;
    And so of these. Which is the natural man,
    And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

AEMELIA

    Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
    And gain a husband by his liberty.
    Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
    That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
    That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
    O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
    And speak unto the same AEmilia!

AEGEON

    If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
    If thou art she, tell me where is that son
    That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

AEMELIA

    By men of Epidamnum he and I
    And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
    But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
    By force took Dromio and my son from them
    And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
    What then became of them I cannot tell
    I to this fortune that you see me in.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Why, here begins his morning story right;
    These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
    And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
    Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
    These are the parents to these children,
    Which accidentally are met together.
    Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    And I with him.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
    Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

ADRIANA

    Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I, gentle mistress.

ADRIANA

    And are not you my husband?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    No; I say nay to that.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    And so do I; yet did she call me so:
    And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
    Did call me brother.

    To Luciana
    What I told you then,
    I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
    If this be not a dream I see and hear.

ANGELO

    That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

ANGELO

    I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

ADRIANA

    I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
    By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    No, none by me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    This purse of ducats I received from you,
    And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
    I see we still did meet each other's man,
    And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
    And thereupon these errors are arose.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    These ducats pawn I for my father here.

DUKE SOLINUS

    It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

Courtezan

    Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

AEMELIA

    Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
    To go with us into the abbey here
    And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
    And all that are assembled in this place,
    That by this sympathized one day's error
    Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
    And we shall make full satisfaction.
    Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
    Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
    My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
    The duke, my husband and my children both,
    And you the calendars of their nativity,
    Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
    After so long grief, such festivity!

DUKE SOLINUS

    With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

    Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
    Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
    Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

    Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    There is a fat friend at your master's house,
    That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
    She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
    I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
    Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not I, sir; you are my elder.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    That's a question: how shall we try it?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, then, thus:
    We came into the world like brother and brother;
    And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
